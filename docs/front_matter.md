# Custom front matter keys

Notes on the custom front matter keys I've defined.

*   `index.best_of` (boolean) -- whether a post is particularly special or notable.
    These posts get a red heard next to them in the post lists.

*   `index.exclude` (boolean) -- if true, a post is excluded from the global "all posts" index.
