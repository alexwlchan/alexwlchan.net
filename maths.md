Between September 2011 and June 2014, I was a maths student at Queens' College, Cambridge.
I've enjoyed maths for years, and this site started as a place to post some of my lecture notes.
Now I've graduated, this page serves as a collection of all my mathematical content.

I was the Part II Student Rep to the [Faculty Teaching Committee][tc] for the academic year 2013&ndash;14.

I've posted my [exam advice for maths students](/exams) (and indeed, any other technical subject).

## Lecture notes

I write all of my lecture notes in [LaTeX][latex].
I have a small number of them posted here for other people to read and use.
I include the compiled PDF, and a link to the source code on Github.

* **IB Geometry**: <a href="geometry.pdf">PDF</a> [LaTeX][geo]
* **IB Linear Algebra**: <a href="linear-algebra.pdf">PDF</a> [LaTeX][linalg]

    Particular thanks to [Prof.&nbsp;Grojnowski][groj], who lectured the course, proofread these notes and allowed me to post them.

* **IB Metric & Topological Spaces**: <a href="met-top-spaces.pdf">PDF</a> [LaTeX][mettop]

<!-- ## CATAM -->

<!-- My other writing about the Cambridge Maths degree can be found under the [Tripos](http://alexwlchan.net/tag/tripos/) tag. This includes some exam advice for first-year students who are new to Tripos, and for anybody looking for Part&nbsp;II lecture notes to study over the IB&ndash;II summer break. -->

## Essays

I've written a handful of essays on maths at different levels. They're not all online yet.

* <a href="http://alexwlchan.net/2013/01/zero/"><strong>Zero</strong></a>: an essay for a Sixth Form discussion group about the historical and mathematical significance of the number zero, and why it took so long to be accepted as a "real" number.
