# This is to fix a warning I got in Ruby 3.3.0 on macOS:

#     em-websocket-0.5.3/lib/em-websocket/handshake04.rb:2: warning:
#     base64 was loaded from the standard library, but will no longer
#     be part of the default gems since Ruby 3.4.0. Add base64 to
#     your Gemfile or gemspec. Also contact author of em-websocket-0.5.3
#     to add base64 into its gemspec.
