title: Candybar and icon recommendations
---

For several years, I've used a piece of software called Candybar to customise the icons on my Mac. About six months ago, the developers of Candybar, Panic, [made the app free](http://www.panic.com/blog/2012/08/candybar-mountain-lion-and-beyond/). As OS X changes, it's plausible that one day, you might be unable to change your icons. Although I've had a license for several years, and so I'm not affected monetarily, I still appreciate the gesture.

Earlier tonight, I was recommending Candybar and a list of my favourite icon sets in a comment on Dreamwidth. Since this might be of interest to other people, I'm posting it here for everyone to read.

<!-- summary -->

Instructions for downloading Candybar are in the [Panic announcement](http://www.panic.com/blog/2012/08/candybar-mountain-lion-and-beyond/). Links to the various icon sets are embedded below.

## Motivation

You might ask why you'd want to customise your icons. Good question. I'm by no means a UI expert, but here's a brief explanation of why I like to do it:

One of the big changes in OS X Leopard was to [remove all semblance of colour from folder icons](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2007/10/mac-os-x-10-5/4/). A similar trend has continued throughout OS X: the sidebar icons in iTunes, iPhoto and Mail have become similarly monochrome. This has generally been seen as a bad move, because colour is an easy way to pick out different icons, and removing it makes it harder to pick out something at a glance.

If you customise your icons, you can make them visually distinctive, and easy to find at a glance. You can also use colour to denote significance (for example, I pick out folders for projects with an imminent deadline in a bright red). It also looks nice.

## Recommendations

So here's the list (originally written for somebody who is both fannishly active and a big Avengers fan). I use almost all of these somewhere on my Mac, and I really like all of them.

* **Avengers folders!** I think you might like these. ;) <http://iconfactory.com/freeware/preview/avre> (Dave Brasgalla) Also in the Avengers theme, here’s a **Tesseract icon**: <http://mantia.me/icons/tesseract/> (Louie Mantia) The Iconfactory have a number of different icon sets for different fandoms: Doctor Who, Star Trek, various comic characters and Studio Ghibli are all lurking in my Candybar library.
* **Coloured folders.** Useful for marking folders that you need to be able to pick out at a glance. <http://ekliptikz.deviantart.com/art/Snow-Leopard-Folder-Colors-162730433> (ekliptikz)
* **Steampunk storage.** Hard drive icons, but made in a steampunk style. Coolest icons ever. <http://iconfactory.com/freeware/preview/stmpnk> (David Lanham)
* **Safari.** Some compass-themed icons that bring some variety to Safari. I really like these. <http://www.pixelresort.com/blog/the-safari-icon-set/> (Michael Flarup)
* **Stores.** Icons for iTunes that aren’t blue circles (I’m currently using the orange iTunes icon) and a Mac App Store icon to match. <http://mantia.me/icons/stores/> (Louie Mantia)
* **Creative Sense.** A set of stunning replacement icons for Adobe Creative Suite. <http://beta.dthought.net/icon-sets/creative-sense/release-2/> (Mike Hopkins)
* **First Class Mail icons. Literally.** A series of four Mail.app icon replacements, styled to look like British stamps. Have the Queen’s head in your dock. <http://dribbble.com/shots/607320-2nd-Class> (Louie Mantia, scroll down for the link)
* **Ive Drives.** Two collections of icons, which provide replacement hard drive icons styled to look like Apple hardware. The first are reminiscent of the Mac mini: <http://mantia.me/icons/ive-drives/> while the second looks like the Apple TV: <http://mantia.me/icons/ive-drives-2/> (Louie Mantia)
* **Katakana and rune folders.** Although I understand neither Japanese of the Elder Fu&#66;ark alphabet, I like the look of these icons, and it would be remiss to omit them. The same designer also has icons for individual characters elsewhere on her dA page. Runes: <http://asgardstudios.deviantart.com/art/Leopard-Folders-Runes-74966895> and Japanese Katakana symbols: <http://asgardstudios.deviantart.com/art/Leopard-Folders-Katakana-74964843> (asgardstudios)

I’ve mentioned Louie Mantia several times in the links above. He’s one of my favourite designers, and as well as icons, he’s designed a lot of wallpapers (<http://mantia.me/wallpaper/>). They’re definitely worth checking out. Themes include Harry Potter, Alice in Wonderland, Brave, a SHIELD wallpaper, and lots of other things that I’m not fannishly aware enough to recognise.

Of course, there are lots of other places to find good icon sets. I've mentioned [The Iconfactory](http://iconfactory.com) above; I've also picked up gems from [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/) and the [icons section of deviantART](http://browse.deviantart.com/customization/icons/) before. Icon designers often post freebies on their personal sites too. And there's nothing to stop you breaking out Photoshop and trying your hand at making one yourself.

Enjoy!
