title: A Flask app for taking notes
---

This is a pretty good plaintext notes web app. I'd been looking for something to use to take notes at work, and I've been trying this for about a month. I think I'll keep using it.

It has all the features I need: Markdown support, full text search, and it runs on Windows. As a bonus, because it's open source, I can easily tweak it where I want. (Some features were added [in later posts](https://charlesleifer.com/blog/tags/saturday-morning-hacks/).)

Flask is a small [web server framework](http://flask.pocoo.org/) for Python that I've been using for a couple of recent projects. I was considering rolling my own notes app, but this one is pretty good.
