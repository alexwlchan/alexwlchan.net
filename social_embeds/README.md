# social embeds

When I embed social media posts, I use lightweight HTML and CSS snippets rather than the native embeds offered by sites.
This has several benefits:

*   I'm protected from link rot or site outages
*   HTML embeds load faster and avoid the creepy tracking from social media sites
*   I can make the embeds match the overall aesthetic of the site

This folder has some data and avatars used to render those embeds.
