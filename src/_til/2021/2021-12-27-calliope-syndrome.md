This is a phrase that goes around the Internet every once in a while, but there's no definitive reference page for it (it doesn't, for example, have a Wikipedia entry).
I wanted to track down where it came from.

## Where does it come from?

Several sources on the Internet point to Judith Wynn Halsted's book *Some of My Best Friends Are Books: Guiding Gifted Readers*.
The Internet Archive has digitised the second edition from 2002, and the relevant passage is [on page 207](https://archive.org/details/someofmybestfrie00hals/page/206/mode/2up?q=syndrome):

> Books that contain pronunciation guides are helpful for gifted readers (though they are rare, and a pleasant surprise when found), since so many avid readers know words only from reading and therefore mispronounce them. One excellent teacher of gifted high school students calls this “The Calley-ope (calliope) Syndrome.”

An almost-identical passage appears in one of her earlier books, *Guiding Gifted Readers*, published in 1988.
(The two books have a very similar structure, so I think this is a "first edition" of *Some of My Best Friends* – but of course, not described that way at time of publication.)
It's been digitised by the Internet Archive and the passage is [on page 126](https://archive.org/details/guidinggiftedrea0000hals/page/126/mode/2up?q=calliope):

> Pronunciation guides are helpful for gifted readers (though they are rare, and a pleasant surprise when found), since so many of them know words only from reading and therefore mispronounce them.

But this doesn't tell me which teacher coined the phrase!
