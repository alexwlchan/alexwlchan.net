The `Content-Disposition` header can be used to tell a browser the filename of an HTTP response.
It's used for "Save As" or when downloading the file.

For example, you might access a URL of the form:

    /files/0645c33f-0be6-44e1-8059-228ec9594867.pdf

If you include a `Content-Disposition` header of the form:

    filename*=utf-8''original_filename.pdf

the browser will download this filename as `original_filename.pdf`.
