Via [a Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1is11rv/python_314_due_out_later_this_year_is_set_to/), it turns out there's a pi-related Easter egg in Python 3.14: you'll be able to start the interpreter with `𝜋thon`.

I found the [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/125035) where this was discussed and merged, including a comment from Hugo van Kemenade:

> Remember, everyone: shhh!

Oops. 😅
