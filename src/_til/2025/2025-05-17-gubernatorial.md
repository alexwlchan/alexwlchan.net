I'm currently reading *A Libertarian Walks Into a Bear*, by Matthew Hongoltz-Hetling, and I was struck by this passage (emphasis mine):

> Just as bear-killing fueled one's manhood, lack of such prowess did the opposite.
> In neighboring Vermont in 1815, Governor Jonas Galusha, seeking reelection, proudly announced that he would hunt a particularly notorious bear known as "Old Slipperyskin" with a hitherto-unknown hunting method.
> Galusha slathered himself with female bear scent and strode off into the woods, only to return to his entourage at a full sprint, the bear behind him.
> (He lost the *gubernatorial* campaign.)

I'd never seen the word *gubernatorial* before.

I could guess it from the context -- Galusha wasn't re-elected as state governor -- but I looked it up, and it turns out it's a word to describe anything related to a governor.
It's mostly used in the USA, which is why it was unfamiliar to me.
The only time I recall using the word "governor" in the UK is to describe a board of school governors, which I'm only vaguely familiar with.
(As I write this, I assume we have governors in our government, but it's not something I've ever thought about.)

An [NPR article][npr] by Acacia Squires explains the history of the word -- it comes from the Latin word *gubernator*, one who governs.
That gives us the English word *governor* via French, which swapped the 'b' for a 'v', but at some point the 'b' returned in the word *gubernatorial*.

I feel like there must be other Latin words where 'b' became 'v', but I'm struggling to think of any except *habere*, to have.
(Double-checking that example is how I discovered that the National Archives have [a guide to medieval Latin][tna].)
