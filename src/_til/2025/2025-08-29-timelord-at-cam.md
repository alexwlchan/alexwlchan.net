NTP is the Network Time Protocol, used to share accurate time information with computers in a network.
The University of Cambridge runs four of them, and if you have questions about it, you'd contact [a delightful email address](https://help.uis.cam.ac.uk/service/network-services/network-time-protocol-ntp/details-of-the-network-time-protocol-service):

> Please address queries about NTP within the University to timelord@uis.cam.ac.uk.

I was told about this as an undergraduate, but it was years later before I thought to check if it was true.
I assume the creator of this email address has long since moved on to other things, but it still makes me smile when I remember it, and I'm glad it's still in use.
