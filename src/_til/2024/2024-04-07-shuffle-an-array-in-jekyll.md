title: How to shuffle an array in a Jekyll template
summary: |
  If you want an array in random order, you can use the `sample` filter to get a random sample of the same size as the original array.
tags:
  - jekyll
  - liquid

# This is to fix a warning in the Jekyll build process:
#
#     Excerpt modified in _til/2024/2024-04-07-shuffle-an-array-in-jekyll.md!
#     Found a Liquid block containing the excerpt separator "\n\n".
#     The block has been modified with the appropriate closing tag.
#     Feel free to define a custom excerpt or excerpt_separator in the
#     document's Front Matter if the generated excerpt is unsatisfactory.
#
# I don't use the autogenerated excerpt, so I just want to shut this up.
excerpt_separator: "???"

As part of the site rebuild, I wanted a way to shuffle a list of selected articles at build time.
This order will get "baked in" to the rendered output, but it still introduces *an* element of randomness and I rebuild the site once a day anyway.

It turns out there's no way to do this in vanilla Liquid, but Jekyll has a [`sample` filter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/filters/#sample) that can pick one or more random values from an array:

```liquid
{% raw %}{% assign fruits = "apple,banana,cherry,damson" | split: "," %}
{% assign fruits = fruits | sample: fruits.size %}

{% for f in fruits %}
  {{ f }}
{% endfor %}{% endraw %}
```

If you look at the [implementation](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/dbbfc5d48c81cf424f29c7b0eebf10886bc99904/lib/jekyll/filters.rb#L355-L364), this is just a thin wrapper about [Array.sample](https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.1/Array.html#method-i-sample), and it has similar behaviour -- e.g. no duplicates, never returns more than the original array.
