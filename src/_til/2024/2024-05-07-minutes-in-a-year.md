I was doing some [date calculations](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=12+million+%2F+%2834000+per+day%29) in Wolfram Alpha, and I was rather tickled by the comparison as time it suggested:

I've never seen *Rent*, but the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasons_of_Love) about the song explains it for me:

> **"Seasons of Love"** is a song from the 1996 Broadway musical *Rent*, written and composed by Jonathan Larson. The song starts with an ostinato piano motif, which provides the harmonic framework for the cast to sing "Five hundred twenty-five thousand, six hundred minutes" (the number of minutes in a common year). The main instruments used throughout the song are piano, vocals, guitar, organ, bass and drums.

I went and listened to [the Broadway cast recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xGUTW3C3gE), and that number does indeed start the song -- three times!
