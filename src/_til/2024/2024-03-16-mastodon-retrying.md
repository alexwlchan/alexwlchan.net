title: How much will Mastodon instances try to re-send messages?

Simon Willison had some DNS issues which meant his personal Mastodon instance (which is similar to my Masto.host setup) was knocked offline for a day or so.
He was [wondering whether](https://fedi.simonwillison.net/@simon/112100279854237102) this would cause a flood of traffic when it came back online:

{% mastodon https://fedi.simonwillison.net/@simon/112100279854237102 %}

And there were a couple of replies to his post, explaining what would happen, including a link to the relevant part of the Mastodon codebase -- if a job fails, it gets retried with an exponential delay.
