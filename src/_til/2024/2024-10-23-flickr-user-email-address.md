Flickr members can control who can see their email address in the "Who can see what" part of the [Privacy & Permissions](https://www.flickr.com/account/privacy) settings.
The default is "nobody".

When I'm signed in and I call this API against my own account, my email address is an attribute on the `profile` element:

```xml
<profile id="199258389@N04" email="alex@alexwlchan.net" â€¦/>
```

This attribute is omitted if I try to look up somebody else's email address and I don't have permission to see it.
