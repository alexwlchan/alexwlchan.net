title: What does “insomnolent” mean?

I came across a new word today, while reading *Wasteland*, by Oliver Franklin-Wallis (emphasis mine):

> 'It doesn't help that I was up for two hours in the middle of the night last night, Thomas, croaks, gamely. He has a nine-month-old baby son who isn't sleeping. I can relate, my youngest daughter being even younger and similarly **insomnolent**.

There are various definitions online that explain it’s to do with sleeping, including [Wikitionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/insomnolent):

> insomnolent: characterized by an inability to sleep, experiencing insomnia.

Now I look at it, I can see that "insomnolent" and "insomnia" have a common root, which in this case is the Latin word "somnus" for sleep.
