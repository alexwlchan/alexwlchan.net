In the past I've written Python scripts that use the `csv` and `sqlite3` modules to convert CSV data into SQLite, but while reading [a Datasette tutorial][tutorial], I discovered that there's a CLI tool called `sqlite-utils` that makes this much easier.

You can [convert a CSV like so][insert_csv]:

```console
$ sqlite-utils insert [DATABASE_NAME] [TABLE_NAME] [CSV_PATH] --csv
```

For example:

```console
$ sqlite-utils insert reallyuseful.db boxes boxes.csv --csv --detect-types
```

This probably won't be exactly the table I want, compared to the precise schema I could write in my own script, but it's a lot faster!
And sqlite-utils has tools for transforming tables too, so I can finesse them if I need something different.

For example, I can make the `names` column a primary key like so:

```console
$ sqlite-utils transform realluseful.db boxes --pk name
```
