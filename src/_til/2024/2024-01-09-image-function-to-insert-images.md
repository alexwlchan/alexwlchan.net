There's an `IMAGE` function in both [Google Sheets] and [Microsoft Excel] that you can use to insert images into cells, in particular from URLs:

```
IMAGE("https://www.google.com/images/srpr/logo3w.png")
```

I used this when we had a list of Flickr URLs with photos that we wanted to review visually -- I added a new column with URLs pointing to the raw JPEGs, and then I used the `IMAGE` formula to display thumbnail photos inline.
