There's a list of [Falsehoods programmers believe about phone numbers](https://github.com/google/libphonenumber/blob/master/FALSEHOODS.md) and item 16 is:

> **All valid phone numbers follow the ITU specifications**
>
> ITU-T specifies that a phone number cannot be longer than fifteen digits, with one to three digits reserved for the country calling code, but valid numbers in Germany have been assigned that are longer than this.

Of course it's the Germans.
