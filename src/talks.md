    <small><strong>PyCon UK</strong>, 18 September 2016</small>

    <p>
      Testing is a cornerstone of software development, but how do we know that we aren&rsquo;t missing bugs?
      Why don&rsquo;t we let the computer write tests for us?
      This is the idea behind <em>property-based testing</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a revised version of my CamPUG talk (below), I explained the idea of property-based testing, the power of the Hypothesis library, and gave some suggestions for using it in practice.

    <a href="/talks/hypothesis-intro/"><h3 class="talk_title">Introduction to property-based testing</h3></a>
    <small><strong>Cambridge Python User Group</strong>, 7 June 2016</small>

    <p>We all know that tests are important, but nobody actually wants to write them.  What if we got a computer to write our tests for us?  This is the one of the motivating factors for property-based testing.</p>

    <p>In this talk, I explained the ideas of property-based testing, and showed it in action with Python's Hypothesis library.  I also demoed stateful testing, and fuzz testing with AFL.</p>

    <h3 class="talk_title">Colossus [slides and notes coming soon]</h3>
    <small><strong>Queens' College Maths Society</strong>, 17 February 2016</small>

    <p><p>Many people have heard of the Allied codebreaking efforts at Bletchley Park during World&nbsp;War&nbsp;II.  The most famous story is Enigma, but it often leads us to overlook the other achievements from Bletchley. One of those is Colossus.</p><p>In this talk, I told the story of Colossus, sometimes described as the world's first computer. I&nbsp;explained the mechanics of the German cipher it was trying to break, how it was broken, and why Colossus was nearly forgotten.</p></p>
