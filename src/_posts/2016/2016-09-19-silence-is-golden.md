summary: PyCon had a dedicated quiet room for people to get some downtime, and I think
  it's a great idea.

As I write this, it's the last day of [PyCon UK](http://2016.pyconuk.org/).
The air is buzzing with the sound of [sprints](http://2016.pyconuk.org/what-are-sprints/) and productivity.
I'll write a blog post about everything that happened at PyCon later (spoiler: I've had a great time), but right now I'd like to write about one specific feature – an idea I'd love to see at every conference.
I've already talked about [live captioning](/2016/09/speech-to-text/) – now let's talk about quiet rooms.

I'm an introvert.
Don't get me wrong: I enjoy socialising at conferences and meetups.
I get to meet new people, or put faces to names I've seen online.
Everybody I've met this week has been lovely and nice, but there's still a limit to how much socialising I can do.
Being in social situations is quite draining, and a full day of conference is more than I can manage in one go.
At some point, I need to step back and recharge.

I don't think this is atypical in the tech/geek communities.

So I've been incredibly grateful that the conference provides a quiet room.
It's exactly what the name suggests – a space set aside for quiet working and sitting.
Whenever I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed by the bustle of the main conference, I can step into the quiet room.
Some clear head space helps me through the day.

PyCon was held in [Cardiff City Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Hall,_Cardiff), and the designated quiet room was the [Council Chamber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Hall,_Cardiff#Council_Chamber).
It's a really nice and large space:

If there hadn't been a quiet room, I'd have worn out much faster and probably been miserable towards the end of the conference.
It made a big difference to my experience.
I think it's a great feature, and I'll be looking for it at the next conference I attend.
