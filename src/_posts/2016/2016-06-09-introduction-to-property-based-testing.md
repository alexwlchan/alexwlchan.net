On Tuesday night, I was talking about testing techniques at the [Cambridge Python User Group][meetup] (CamPUG for short).
I was talking primarily about property-based testing and the Python library [Hypothesis][hyp], but I included an introduction to the ideas of stateful testing, and fuzz testing with [american fuzzy lop (afl)][afl].

I was expecting the traditional property-based testing would be the main attraction, and the stateful and fuzz testing would just be nice extras.
In fact, I think interest was pretty evenly divided between the three topics.

I've posted the slides and my rough notes.
Thanks to everybody who came on Tuesday – I had a really good evening.
