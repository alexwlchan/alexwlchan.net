title: The Skeletor clip loop, 2015 edition
---

As is becoming a tradition, *The Incomparable* posted their [2015 Clip Show](https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/281/index.php) a few weeks ago, which extended Steve Lutz's recursive Skeletor clip loop.
Slightly later than usual, I've updated the chart I maintain to track the progress of the clip loop.

I call this the "Oh god, what have we done" edition.

A few changes this year:

*   Different mentions within the same episode get different points on the chart.  Trying to contain all the mentions within an episode around a single point was getting unwieldy.

*   I completely redrew and rewrote the chart this year.  The old version was made in [OmniGraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle), but I've switched to using [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) and [Ti*k*Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGF/TikZ).  I already use those tools very heavily, so it will be much easier for me to make updates in future.  I've also provided source code -- so you can make your own clip loop at home!

*   This year's clip show added no less than **four** events to the chart.  I also added an entry for [Nathan Gouwens's interactive audio chart](http://gouwens.net/skeletors-all-the-way-down/).

It's possible that this clip loop is getting a little silly. All we need now are some [bowls of stew](https://www.theincomparable.com/tpk/45/index.php)â€¦
