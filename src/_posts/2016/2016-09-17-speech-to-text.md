This weekend, I've been attending [PyCon UK](http://2016.pyconuk.org) in Cardiff.
This is my first time at a PyCon (or indeed, at any tech conference), and one nice surprise has been the live captioning of the talks.

At the front of the main room, there are two [speech-to-text reporters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech-to-text_reporter) transcribing the talk in real-time.
Their transcription is shown as live, scrolling text on several large screens throughout the room, and shows up within seconds of the speaker finishing a word.

Here's what one of those screens looks like:

I'm an able-bodied person.
I appreciate the potential value of live captioning for people with hearing difficulties &ndash; but my hearing is fine.
I wasn't expecting to use the transcription.

Turns out &ndash; live captioning is really useful, even if you can already hear what the speaker is saying!

Maintaining complete focus for a long time is remarkably hard.
Inevitably, my focus slips, and I miss something the speaker says &ndash; a momentary distraction, my attention wanders, or somebody coughs at the wrong moment.
Without the transcript, I have to fill in the blank myself, and there's a few seconds of confusion before I get back into the talk.
With the transcript, I can see what I missed.
I can jump straight back in, without losing my place.
I've come to rely on the transcript, and I miss it when I'm in talks without it.
(Unfortunately, live captioning is only in one of the three rooms running talks.)

And I'm sure I wasn't the only person who found them helpful.
I saw and heard comments from lots of other people about the value of the live captioning, and it was great for them to get a call-out [in Saturday's opening remarks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLP_L3TpPkI#t=6m25s).
This might be pitched as an accessibility feature, but it can help everybody.

If you're running a conference (tech or otherwise), I would strongly recommend providing this service.
