title: The Incomparable's "Best Of" 2015
---

Yesterday *The Incomparable* podcast posted their [2015 wrap-up show](https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/281/index.php).
This is always a good episode – the panellists recap their favourite media from the last year, which is always a source of good recommendations, and discuss highlights from a year of podcasting.
Every year, I come away with a long list of things to look up later.

(This is also the annual episode for perpetuating [the infamous Skeletor clip loop](/skeletor/).)

I've written a list of everything recommended in the first half of the show, so that I can look it up later.
This is no substitute for listening to the episode itself, but hopefully it will serve as a useful reference for other listeners.

<!-- summary -->

*   No links, but most of these are fairly easy to find on Google.
*   If you listen to the episode in a podcast app with chapter markers, the headings correspond to the chapters.
