On Thursday evening, I went to a [Queering the Collection] event at work.
It's part of a series of events to mark [the closing of Medicine Man][beyond], and to reflect on the legacy of the objects it displays.
I had a fun evening -- Nan and Tabs put together an interesting set of activities, that was more thoughtful and challenging than I'd expected.
I'd only skimmed the event description, so I was expecting something more akin to a tour or a lecture.

At the start of the session, we were invited to wander around the exhibit, and find objects that reminded us of being queer (I forget the exact wording).
Nan read us [a quote from Bell Hooks][bellhooks] about "queer" being an expansive, broad-ranging term, and then we were left to wander.

This is the point at which I have to admit I always feel a bit uncomfortable Medicine Man.
I find it a dark, somewhat oppressive space, and I always feel a bit weird wandering among the display cases.
Rather than look at the objects, I found myself drawn to the wall of paintings:

I walked up and down, and one painting caught my eye.
I stopped to look closer, and although it's ostensibly a painting of four people studying an anatomical skeleton, I got a slightly different read.

<img src="/images/2022/st-dunstans_1x.jpg" srcset="/images/2022/st-dunstans_1x.jpg 1x, /images/2022/st-dunstans_2x.jpg 2x, /images/2022/st-dunstans_3x.jpg 3x" class="fullwidth_img" alt="A painting of four people sitting around a skeleton suspended from the ceiling. Their heads are at the same height as the skeleton’s pelvis, and they're looking at each other rather than the skeleton itself. The painting is in a black frame, with a caption “Anatomy lessons at St Dunstan’s”.">

I spotted it because I'd been reading tweets about the oft-repeated rhetoric "archaeologists will dig up your bones and decide what your gender was" -- but it goes deeper than that.

I thought about how there are people who can't look past labels like "gay" or "lesbian" or "trans".
When they hear those words, that becomes their sole view of the other person.
The rest of the person -- their personality, nuance, and life -- gets stripped away.

In a way, that's what's happening to this skeleton.
It used to be a person – perhaps they were a child, or a friend, or a lover, but now they've been reduced to a skeleton.
The rest of their life has been stripped away.
They're not being seen as anything else.

And the four individuals in the lesson aren't looking at the skeleton; they're talking to each other.
They're talking around it.
It reminded me of how the queer community is often discussed without involving any queer people, based on fantasy interpretations of how queer people behave.

(I was also reminded of the mummified body that used to be Medicine Man, which was removed from display as part of [a series of interventions][intervention] to reflect on colonial collecting practices.
The idea of human remains as display objects is slowly – too slowly – changing.)

I doubt the artist was trying to represent a queer experience, but I found a resonance there anyway.
Other people at the event found examples of queerness as solidarity, the messiness of being queer, and the difficulties of coming out.

I'm used to going into a gallery and being told how to interpret the displays; it was strange to be asked how I felt about the exhibits.
I don't remember the last time I was in a museum and explicitly invited to provide my own interpretation -- but I quite liked it.
I've been to Medicine Man a dozen times, and I got more out of this trip than I have in a while.
I wouldn't want to do this every time, but it was an interesting way to shake up my museum experience.
