Last night, I [posted a tweet][tweet] wondering about the different colours of the ["spool of thread" emoji][emoji], and I made an illustration to show the variety:

{%
  picture
  filename="emoji.png"
  width="587"
  alt="A collection of different thread emojis, labelled by the platform/company they’re from. There are four red spools on the left, two blue spools on the right, a purple and two pink spools along the top, and a green spool along the bottom."
%}

The emoji icons are from [Emojipedia], and I've labelled each one with the name of the platform it comes from.
Notice that I've colour-matched each label to the emoji, and it's a different colour for each label -- how did I pick the colours?

I already have code [to extract dominant colours from images][dominant_colours], using *k*-means clustering.
I was able to use the script from the end of that post to get a list of suggestions:

{%
  picture
  filename="terminal_without_colours.png"
  width="587"
  alt="A terminal window running a Python script that prints five hex colours."
  style="border-radius: 6px;"
%}

Problem is, I can't visualise colours from their hex codes.
Which colour is the murky brown, and which is the vibrant pink?
Wouldn't it be nicer if I could *see* the colours?

I found a [Perl function] that prints coloured blocks to the terminal using [ANSI escape codes].
I rewrote it in Python, and then I could see the hex code and the colour it represented:

{%
  picture
  filename="terminal_with_colours.png"
  width="587"
  alt="A terminal window running a Python script that prints five hex colours, and a solid block of colour to the left of each code."
  style="border-radius: 6px;"
%}

Here's my Python function:

```python
def coloured_square(hex_string):
    """
    Returns a coloured square that you can print to a terminal.
    """
    hex_string = hex_string.strip("#")
    assert len(hex_string) == 6
    red = int(hex_string[:2], 16)
    green = int(hex_string[2:4], 16)
    blue = int(hex_string[4:6], 16)

    return f"\033[48:2::{red}:{green}:{blue}m \033[49m"
```

The function returns a string that prints a single coloured square, which you can use and print like any other string.
This won't work in every terminal app, but it works in the one I use (iTerm2), and that's good enough for my needs.

I don't fully understand ANSI escape codes, but reading the [Wikipedia entry] while writing this post helped me understand what's going on.
The `\033[…m` marks the escape code, and `48:2::r:g:b` sets the background colour of the terminal.
Typing a single space draws the square of colour, and then `49` restores the default background colour.

Scrolling up on that page, I see that `38:2::r:g:b` lets you set the foreground colour, and that lets me write another interesting function:

```python
def coloured_string(s, *, hex_string):
    """
    Returns a coloured string that you can print to a terminal.
    """
    hex_string = hex_string.strip("#")
    assert len(hex_string) == 6
    red = int(hex_string[:2], 16)
    green = int(hex_string[2:4], 16)
    blue = int(hex_string[4:6], 16)

    return f"\033[38:2::{red}:{green}:{blue}m{s}\033[39m"
```

Notice that the result now ends `39` to restore the default foreground colour, not `49`.
I got that wrong on my first attempt!

Combine this with something like [Unicode block elements], and this could be a very powerful tool.
For example, I can use a lower seven-eights block to add a gap between squares, and colour the hex swatches to match:

{%
  picture
  filename="terminal_with_coloured_text.png"
  width="587"
  alt="A terminal window running a Python script that prints five hex colours, and a solid block of colour to the left of each code. The hex codes have the same colour as the blocks."
  style="border-radius: 6px;"
%}

This is even more useful -- it makes it visually obvious that, for example, the last colour would be unsuitable for text on a white background.

All this might seem like overkill for a throwaway tweet, but I'm bound to use it in other places.
Now I've done this, I have two functions that I can drop into any project that involves colours – and unlike a library, I completely understand how they work.
Writing blog post was a key part of that understanding – by explaining it to you, I first have to explain it to myself.

Being able to see colours in my terminal has been a "wouldn't it be nice if" debugging idea for a while, but I've never got round to it before.
Now I have, it's a single copy/paste to start reaping the benefits, so I'm much more likely to do it -- and maybe you will too.
