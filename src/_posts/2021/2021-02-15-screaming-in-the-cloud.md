Early last year, in a fit of lockdown-induced ridiculousness, I wrote some [code that turned DynamoDB into a calculator](/2020/04/using-dynamodb-as-a-calculator/).

This caught the attention of [Corey Quinn](https://twitter.com/quinnypig), another lover of ridiculous ideas, and he invited me on his podcast, *Screaming in the Cloud*, to talk about what I'd done.
We had a fun conversation about how I wrote the calculator, some of the digital preservation work I do at Wellcome, and how the cloud factors into both of those.
You can listen to the podcast or read a transcript at [lastweekinaws.com](https://www.lastweekinaws.com/podcast/screaming-in-the-cloud/using-the-cloud-to-preserve-the-future-with-alex-chan/).

(The episode was posted in October, but I forgot to mention it here because I'm a scatterbrain.)
