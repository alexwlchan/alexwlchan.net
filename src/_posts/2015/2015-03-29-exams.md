title: Some exam advice
---

As the exam season approaches, I see a gentle trickle of hits to my [exam advice](/2014/05/part-ia-exams/) for first-year maths students. It's been a year since I wrote it, and I still agree with almost all of it.

Looking it over, I think a lot of it is applicable to other technical subjects, so I've tidied it up and tried to make the advice a little less maths-specific. Rather than letting it get lost in my blog archives, I've also given it a new, permanent page.

I hope people continue to read it and find it useful, and I wish the best of luck to everybody sitting exams in May.
