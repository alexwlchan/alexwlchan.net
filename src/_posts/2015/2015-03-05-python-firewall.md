title: Adding Python to the OS X firewall

If you ever get the warning *"Do you want the application "python" to accept incoming connections?"* on OS X, then somebody on Stack Overflow has helpfully written some instructions to keep it quiet.

My current side project is a bookmarking app written in Flask, and I get this  message every time the app restarts. It's mildly annoying, and I'm glad to see the back of it.
