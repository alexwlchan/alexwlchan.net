title: What went wrong at King's Cross over Christmas?
---

There were highly publicised problems and delays at King's Cross Station over the Christmas period, for the nebulous reasons of "engineering works". But to their credit, about a fortnight ago, Network Rail [published a full report][1] about the disruption, explaining how the carefully planned works overran so badly.

The report goes into a lot of detail, and it's well worth reading. But if you just want a high-level overview of the major problems, then this summary is the best that I've read so far.
