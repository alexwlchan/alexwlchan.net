> In an Empire Podcast first, readers posed their Twitter questions, queries and grievances about movie ratings direct to the man who oversees them on a daily basis, BBFC [British Board of Film Classification] executive director David Austin. Why was *Gremlins* rated 15? What ever happened to *What Ever Happened To Baby Jane?*'s 18 rating? Whatâ€™s a 12A for, anyway? And what happened with *A Good Day To Die Hard*?

I thought this was a fascinating podcast about how the BBFC works: how they decide on a film's rating, the way they choose the criteria for each rating, and changing attitudes towards adult content in films. It's a very candid interview: Austin answers all of the questions head-on, in a very honest and reasonable way.

If you have any interest in film or cinema, then I think it's definitely worth a listen.
