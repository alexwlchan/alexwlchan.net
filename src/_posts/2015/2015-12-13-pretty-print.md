title: Pretty printing JSON and XML in the shell
---

Last year I read Craig Hockenberry's [magnus opus](http://furbo.org/2014/09/03/the-terminal/) – a huge collection of information about the OS X Terminal and the Bash shell.
It's worth reading in its entirety, even if you don't use a Mac.
My favourite tips were opt-clicking to jump around in Terminal (which makes Vim far more usable for me), and using the `lsof` command when a disk won't eject.
Both super useful.

At the same time, I read [Dr. Drang's suggestion](http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2014/09/chock-amok/) that we write up our own tips.
I wrote this post at the time, and then it sat in drafts for over a year.
Oops.
Anyway, here are a few tips from me.

I work a lot with website APIs, which typically return responses that are formatted in XML or JSON.
To save bandwidth, these responses are [minified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_(programming)) (stripped of unnecessary whitespace and newlines).
That's fine for a program, but it's quite painful if I'm reading it.

Luckily, OS X includes a few tools for pretty printing JSON and XML.
This makes the responses substantially easier to read for a human.

*   To tidy up JSON, pipe the output to `python -m json.tool`:

    ```console
    $ curl "https://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/staff.tumblr.com/avatar"
    {"meta":{"status":301,"msg":"Found"},"response":{"avatar_url":"https:\/\/38.media.tumblr.com\/avatar_0d81f376bcbd_64.png"}}

    $ curl "https://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/staff.tumblr.com/avatar" | python -m json.tool
    {
        "meta": {
            "msg": "Found",
            "status": 301
        },
        "response": {
            "avatar_url": "https://38.media.tumblr.com/avatar_0d81f376bcbd_64.png"
        }
    }
    ```

    When you invoke Python with the `-m` flag, it executes a [module as a script](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0338/) – as if you ran the file directly.
    The [json.tool](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/json.html?highlight=json.tool#module-json.tool) module acts as a pretty printer for text received on stdin.
    It also has extra arguments for writing the output to a file, or sorting the keys.

    Since the json module is part of Python's standard library, this will work on any system that has Python installed.

*   To tidy up XML, pipe the output to `xmlint --format -`:

    ```console
    $ curl "http://xkcd.com/rss.xml"
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <rss version="2.0"><channel><title>xkcd.com</title><link>http://xkcd.com/</link><description>xkcd.com: A webcomic of romance and math humor.</link></description><language>en</language><item><title>Red Car</title> ...

    $ curl "http://xkcd.com/rss.xml" | xmllint --format -
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <rss version="2.0">
      <channel>
        <title>xkcd.com</title>
        <link>http://xkcd.com/</link>
        <description>xkcd.com: A webcomic of romance and math humor.</description>
        <language>en</language>
        <item>
          <title>Red Car</title>
    ...
    ```

    This is just the tip of what xmllint can do – and it turns out Apple has been quietly including it since [at least Mavericks](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/xmllint.1.html).
    It's available in the package manager of most Linux distros.

    I don't use the advanced features much – once I want to start unpicking the XML, I break out Python and the [xml.etree module](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html?highlight=elementtree) – but it's useful for quick debugging and raw responses.
