Given today's news that [people are falling through the cracks in the Electoral Register][1], I thought try to spread the link for registering to vote. I did it this morning, and it took about five minutes. Really easy.

On a side note, I'm continually impressed with the design of the GOV.UK site. It has a very crisp and clean look, and the [New Transport typeface][2] gives it a distinctive feel. It's probably one of the best-designed sites I use on a (semi-)regular basis.
