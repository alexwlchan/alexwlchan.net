title: Getting Started Testing, by Ned Batchelder
category: Programming and code
---

This PyCon talk is a great introduction to unit tests and mocking.
It starts from having a common position &ndash; having no tests &ndash; and steps you through gradual improvements until you have a proper unit test framework.
The second half is a clear, concise explanation of mocking.

If you've never done any testing, this is a really good place to start.
If you already know how to test, it's a good opportunity to revisit the fundamentals.

And even though this is a PyCon talk, it applies to all programming languages.
The examples are Python, but the ideas apply everywhere.
