title: Kitchen sink security

I was going through some old paperwork recently, and I found some old bank cards that had expired. It's good practice [to destroy expired cards][money.se], so that the numbers on them can't be used for identity theft.

The normal way to destroy a card is to shred it. If you want to go one step better, you can try erasing the numbers from the card entirely. I found quite a fun way to do this, using nothing but things I found in my kitchen. Here's what I did:

I boiled a kettle, filled a mug with boiling water, then I dropped my card in it. I saw the raised plastic numbers dissolve almost instantly, and soon after, the plastic film on which the numbers are actually printed came away as well. After five minutes, the [EMV chip][emv] fell out as well. I poked and prodded at it with some cutlery -- I don't think this helps with the security, but it was fun to see how weirdly I could bend the card. (Several cards had four or five folds.)

Once I was done, I fished it out and ran it under the cold tap to harden the plastic. Then I chopped it into small pieces, and scattered them across several bins.

This doesn't make it impossible for somebody to read the numbers from my card, but it makes it quite a bit harder. (I can still make out very faint outlines, but I know what numbers used to be there -- I don't know if somebody else could read them.) Overall, I'm calling that a win.
