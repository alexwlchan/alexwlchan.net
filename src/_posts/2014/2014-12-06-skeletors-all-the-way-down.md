title: Skeletors All the Way Down
---

Back [in June][me], I had fun making an image chart to track all of the Skeletor references on the Incomparable podcast. Now, "that guy who made the relationships graphs" (Nathan Gouwens, who also made a [great graph to track which panellists][panel] were on shows together) has one-upped me.

He's made an interactive chart which shows not only which episodes featured Skeletor mentions, but also links to the exact clip in which it was discussed. And as it drops back through the different clip shows, it highlights the connection between them. It's a really nice piece of work.

And now, if you'll excuse me, I have to indulge in some Skeletor nostalgia.
