I was talking about some of my work tonight, and some of the writing I've done to make my work comprehensible to colleagues who aren't software developers.
Although it's a cliche, I took care never to use the phrase *"non-technical users"*.

A lot of my colleagues aren't software developers, but that doesn't mean they're not technically capabable -- it just means their specialism is in another field.

I used the alternative phrasing *"cultural heritage professionals who aren't software developers"*.
It's wordier, but it puts us all on the same level -- we're all professionals, just in different fields -- and doesn't create an implicit hierarchy between developers and non-developers.
