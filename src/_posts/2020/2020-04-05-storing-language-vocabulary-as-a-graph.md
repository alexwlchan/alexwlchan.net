If you've ever tried to learn a foreign language, you've probably encountered a *vocabulary list*.
It's a list of words and phrases, accompanied by a translation into a language you already know.

Here's an example with English and German:

<figure style="width: 450px;">
  {% inline_svg "_images/2020/german_vocabulary_list.svg" %}
</figure>

This is an efficient way to store the data, and it allows for fast lookups if there's a word you don't know.
(Assuming you know how to [find a word in the list](/2019/06/reading-a-chinese-dictionary/).)
It's how every dictionary and phrase book I've ever read has been laid out.

A vocabulary list treats each word/translation pair as a discrete unit, to be learnt individually.
**But I don't learn words in isolation -- my brain forms connections between related words, and remembering the connections helps me remember the words.**
Sometimes these connections are very obvious and explicit; sometimes they're a weird quirk of my brain.

For example, in Chinese, the word 电 (electricity) appears in a number of other words.
A 电话 (electric words) is a telephone.
A 电视 (electric looking) is a television.
A 电车 (electric vehicle) is a tram.
You could learn all three words separately, but I find it easier to remember them together.

One way to represent connections between related objects is to use [a graph] (as in [graph theory], not as in charts).
We can apply this idea to vocabulary: each phrase is a vertex, and two phrases are connected by an edge if they're related in some way.
Here's the graph for 电:

<figure style="width: 400px;">

</figure>

Rather than learning the four words individually, I can learn this mini-cluster, and remember them together.
Having the narrative that connects them makes it easier for them to stick in my brain.

I connect words in all sorts of ways, including:

-   If they have a _common component_ or root (such as 电–, above)
-   If they have a _related meaning_ (such as words for family members, or directions, or modes of transport)
-   If they _trigger a shared memory_ (I have fragments of Slovenian tied together by a holiday to Ljubljana)

**The exact connections are unimportant; what I find interesting is the general idea of modelling vocabulary as a graph.**

{% text_separator "— 口 —" %}

Normally, when I draw these graphs, I work on a fairly small scale.
I imagine the connections between a handful of words, usually starting from a single word and listing words it's connected to.
The graph forms a star shape, like the example above.
If we were to draw out the graph of all the vocabulary I know, we'd get something much bigger and more complex.

<figure style="width: 300px; margin-top: -1em; margin-bottom: -1em;">
  {% inline_svg "_images/2020/complex_graph.svg" %}
</figure>

**Wouldn't it be interesting to see that bigger graph?**
What new connections or associations might I find if I could see everything together?

I've been thinking about this idea for a while, and over the last week I've done some experiments to try to pull such a graph together.

{% text_separator "— 大 —" %}

I usually sketch little graphs on scrap paper during a lesson, as a way to remember the words in the lesson.
That works well on a small scale, but you can see it's already getting a bit messy: lines are overlapping, phrases are getting boxed in, and I'm running out of room on the paper.

<figure style="width: 500px;">
  {%
    picture
    filename="chinese_directions.jpg"
    alt="A handwritten page with various characters and arrows between them."
    visible_width="500px"
  %}
</figure>

I wanted to see if drawing this graph digitally would be any better: in theory, a digital canvas makes it easier to rearrange the graph, and it can extend forever.

There are two parts here: I need to be able to store the graph data (the words and their connections), and then to render that data as a picture.
I found some libraries to do the hard bits:

-   [**networkx**](https://pypi.org/project/networkx/) is a Python package for creating and manipulating data about graph networks.
	  It has a good API and excellent documentation.

-   [**D3.js**](https://d3js.org/) is a JavaScript library for creating data visualisations, including [network graphs](https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/network).
	  I found a few examples online, which I took and adapted to display my vocabulary graphs.

I wrapped these two libraries in a web app using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/), and then added some words to see how well it works.
That gives me a page that shows me a phrase and everything that is either directly related or one step away:

{%
  picture
  filename="vocab_graph.png"
  style="border: 2px solid #725001; border-radius: 7px;"
  alt="Screenshot of a web app with a graph connecting some Chinese characters."
  visible_width="750px"
%}

The graph is interactive: I can click on a phrase to jump to it, and see a graph with its related phrases.
**I can explore the vocabulary by using the graph.**

I'd underestimated the complexity of drawing a graph that looks nice -- when D3 renders the graph, it often shows something with lots of overlapping lines.
You should be able to rearrange vertices to get a more pleasing pattern, but I've broken something and dragging only works intermittently.

When I started, I wanted to see the entire graph at once.
It's very messy and unwieldy in D3 – I still like the idea, but it needs more work to be usable.
Nonetheless, **in its current form, this works well as a way to _store_ the entire graph, and it's useful to see the subset of the graph centred on a particular phrase.**
I can imagine myself redrawing that on paper, both to get a prettier graph and to help reinforce the knowledge.

If you want to play with the graphs, visit **[chinese-vocabulary-graph.glitch.me](https://chinese-vocabulary-graph.glitch.me/)**

The code for the experiment is on GitHub (**[github.com/alexwlchan/vocabulary-graph](https://github.com/alexwlchan/vocabulary-graph)**), although it's pretty rough -- this is a prototype, not a production app.

{% text_separator "— 小 —" %}

I'm sure this isn't a new concept -- if nothing else, I have sketches of similar graphs from school exercise books, and that's over a decade ago.
But I'm not a cognitive scientist or a linguist, I don't know anything about these fields, and I've struggled to find anything that sounds similar on Google.
If there are other examples, I don't know where to find them.

I don't know if this wil go anywhere.
I might keep updating the app with more words, or I might leave it to wither, but either way this was a fun experiment.
I feel there's a valuable idea here, even if the execution needs some polish.

**There's definitely something useful in organising information as a graph.**
I'd heard people use the term ["knowledge graph"][ontology] in the past, but the meaning and value hadn't really clicked until now.
Long-term, the biggest benefit I get from this experiment might not be a better vocabulary tool, but a better way to store general information and notes.
