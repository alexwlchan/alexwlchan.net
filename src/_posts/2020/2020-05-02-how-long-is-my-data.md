Yesterday, Stuart Lewis posted a photo of his [latest hardware](https://twitter.com/stuartlewis/status/1255825450485628928):

After some [back-and-forth in our replies](https://twitter.com/stuartlewis/status/1256135586651439112), he made me realise that the true unit of data isn't bytes or volume, it's shelving length.
Specifically, if you wrote all your data to 3&#189;&Prime; floppy disks, how much shelf space would you need to hold them all?

To help answer this critically important question, I wrote an app that calculates just that: [alexwlchan.net/fun-stuff/howlongismydata/](/fun-stuff/howlongismydata/).
