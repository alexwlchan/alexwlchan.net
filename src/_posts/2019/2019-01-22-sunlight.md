Over the last few months, it's become really obvious how much sunlight affects my mood levels.

If I commute in darkness, I'm miserable. <br/>
If I commute in daylight, I'm a lot happier.

This might sound a bit like seasonal affective disorder (SAD), and I do wonder if it's something like that.
SAD is a type of depression that follows the seasons, and is usually worse in winter.

I have friends with fairly severe SAD, who feel tired all the time during the winter months, and it's never been as bad as that for me, so until now I've assumed I didn't have any form of SAD.

Maybe I do, maybe I don't -- but I can look to SAD treatment for tips and ideas to make my life easier.
In particular, getting as much natural light as possible, and a sun lamp or six.
(I have a friend with a small solar system in their front room, and the effect on their mood is ~noticeable~.)

If any of this sounds familiar to you, you might want to check out [medical advice for SAD](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder-sad/), and try some of the coping mechanisms yourself.

In the meantime, spring is fast approaching -- just check out this blue sky from today's commute:
