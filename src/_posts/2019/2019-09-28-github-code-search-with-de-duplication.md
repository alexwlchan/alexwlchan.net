---

When I'm trying to learn a new library or function, I often [search for code that uses it on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/searching-code).
Finding examples of other people's usage helps me understand how to use it myself, especially if the docs are patchy or unhelpful.

But GitHub search often includes duplicate results -- if the same file has been copied into ten different repos, that shows up as ten search results.
If I'm trying to find distinct examples of how to use a particular function or API, that duplication isn't very useful.

Plain Git has some neat mechanisms for de-duplication, and you can search code across public repositories [with the GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-code).
I had a play yesterday, and I was able to come up with a search implementation that combines search results if they point to identical files:

<figure>
  <img src="/images/2019/github_code_search.png" alt="A page of search results, with a snippet of code accompanying each search result."/>
  <figcaption>
    Notice how the first search result has a repo/path and then "+11 duplicates".
  </figcaption>
</figure>

It starts by comparing SHA1 hashes of files -- if two files have the same SHA1 hash, they're the same -- and it also looks for files that are similar but not identical.
If two files have the same text, but different [line endings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline), they're treated as the same.

It's an experiment, rather than a hardened search tool -- it's pretty slow, and it can only fetch a single page of results -- but it proves the idea.
You'd need a bunch of work to turn this into a production search implementation, and that's the tricky bit.
Nonetheless, I'm quite pleased with how well it works, given I spent just a few hours on it.

If you're interested, all the code is [on GitHub](https://github.com/alexwlchan/github-code-search).
