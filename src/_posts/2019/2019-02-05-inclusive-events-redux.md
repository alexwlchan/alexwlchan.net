Last year, I wrote [a blog post](/2018/08/inclusive-conferences/) with my ideas for running inclusive conferences.
I was thrilled by the number of people who read, shared, or gave me feedback and suggestions.
I kept all the suggestions in a text file, but I never quite got around to writing an updated post.

Just before the weekend, I sent a link to the post in a reply to this tweet by Ada Powers:

{% tweet https://twitter.com/mspowahs/status/1091409665290788864 %}

Her original tweet got a huge response (so many good replies), and sent a spike of traffic to my old blog post.
I realised it was time to update it properly, so I dusted it off and wrote a new version.
You can read my updated advice at <https://alexwlchan.net/ideas-for-inclusive-events/>.

The new version includes:

*   Lots of suggestions and corrections that were sent in for the first version
*   A proper [acknowledgements page](https://alexwlchan.net/ideas-for-inclusive-events/other-awesome-people/) for all the conferences and people who've given me ideas for the list
*   A summary section.
    The original post was 6.5k words, and the new one is nearly 9k.
    That's a lot of words, and the summary lets you get the core ideas without reading the whole thing.
*   Source code on GitHub: <https://github.com/alexwlchan/ideas-for-inclusive-events>
*   A pleasant green theme

And because it's no longer a point-in-time snapshot (like a blog post), I'm hoping to update this version a little more regularly.
