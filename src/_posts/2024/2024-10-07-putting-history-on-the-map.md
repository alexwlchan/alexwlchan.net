Back in July, we built an [interactive map](https://commons.flickr.org/map/) for the [Flickr Commons Explorer](https://commons.flickr.org/).

I wrote [an article for the Flickr blog][blog] about some of the photos I found using the map -- including Antarctic explorers, northern factories, and Hawaiian industry.
