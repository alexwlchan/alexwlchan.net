I use [the Flickr API][api] pretty much every day in [my day job].
Within the first week, I bashed together a couple of command-line tools to make a simple tool for exploring the API.
They're not meant for building "proper" apps, more for quick experiments and seeing what API responses look like.

The main tool is `flapi`, and you pass it two arguments: the name of the API method, and (optionally) any query parameters you want to include.
Then it calls the Flickr API for you!

For example:

```console?prompt=$
$ flapi flickr.photos.getInfo photo_id=25260341744
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<rsp stat="ok">
  <photo id="25260341744" secret="3e30df4a20" server="1645" farm="2" dateuploaded="1458345230" isfavorite="0" license="7" safety_level="0" rotation="0" originalsecret="b473e4a3b0" originalformat="jpg" views="83654" media="photo">
    â€¦
```

There are lots of ways to play with APIs -- colleagues at a previous job used Postman, and Flickr itself has an API Explorer where you can try requests in the browser.
I like doing it with a command-line tool because I always have lots of terminal windows open, and it's easy to grab one and check something with `flapi`.

Today I finally took the time to tidy up the script [and post it on GitHub][github].

The code isn't complicated -- indeed, it was easy to cobble it together from a bunch of other tools.
Even if you have no interest in the Flickr API, some of them might be useful for you.

*   I'm using [keyring] to store and retrieve my Flickr API key in the macOS Keychain.
    This is a Python library that makes it easy to manage passwords and other secrets, and to avoid hard-coding secrets in my code.

*   I use [curl] to make the actual HTTP request.
    I recently listened to an [interesting interview][readme] with Daniel Stenberg, curl's creator and maintainer, where he talked about how curl got started and how he keeps it going.

*   I pipe the output to [`xmllint --format`][xmllint], which pretty-prints the XML.
    I'm not sure how much of a difference it makes to Flickr's API responses, but it's nice to remember that macOS has a built in reformatter for XML.

*   Finally, I pipe the reformatted XML to [Pygments] to add syntax highlighting.
    For me, this makes the output a bit easier to read.

Put together, the core logic of `flapi` is just four lines:

```bash
api_key=$(keyring get flickr_api key)

curl --silent "https://api.flickr.com/services/rest/?api_key=${api_key}&method=${method}&${params}" \
  | xmllint --format - \
  | pygmentize -l xml
```

These four programs feel like an exemplar of the Unix Way: small tools that each do one task well, written so they can be combined in complex ways.
