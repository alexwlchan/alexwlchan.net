I wrote about a recent conference trip for the Flickr.org blog:

> In September, Tori and I went to Belgium for iPres 2024. We were keen to chat about digital preservation and discuss some of our ideas for Data Lifeboat – and enjoy a few Belgian waffles, of course!
>
> We ran a workshop called “How do you preserve 50 billion photos?” to talk about the challenges of archiving social media at scale. We had about 30 people join us for a lively discussion. Sadly we don’t have any photos of the workshop, but we did come away with a lot to think about, and we wanted to share some of the ideas that emerged.
