I've written a post on [the Flickr Foundation blog](https://www.flickr.org/improving-millions-of-files-on-wikimedia-commons-with-flickypedia-backfillr-bot/) about Flickypedia Backfillr Bot, a new bot I built last year and which has been running ever since:

> Last year, we built [Flickypedia], a new tool for copying photos from Flickr to [Wikimedia Commons]. As part of our planning, we asked for feedback on Flickr2Commons and analysed other tools. We spotted two consistent themes in the community’s responses:
>
> * Write more structured data for Flickr photos
> * Do a better job of detecting duplicate files
>
> We tried to tackle both of these in Flickypedia, and initially, we were just trying to make our uploader better. Only later did we realize that we could take our work a lot further, and retroactively apply it to improve the metadata of the millions of Flickr photos already on Wikimedia Commons. At that moment, [Flickypedia Backfillr Bot] was born. Last week, the bot completed its millionth update, and we guesstimate we will be able to operate on another 13 million files.

> The main goals of the Backfillr Bot are to improve the structured data for Flickr photos on Wikimedia Commons and to make it easier to find out which photos have been copied across. In this post, I’ll talk about what the bot does, and how it came to be.
