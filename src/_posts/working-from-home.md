For the last year, I’ve been commuting from Cambridge to an office in London.
The office is near King’s Cross station, so on a fast train with no delays, it’s about 90 minutes each way – or about 15 hours of commuting a week.
Turns out, that’s a lot!

Several weeks ago, I got home on the Thursday evening, and I was *exhausted*.
I’d had some severe train delays that week, and I was crying tied.
As a short term fix, I worked from home on the Friday – and I finally realised that 15+ hours of commuting was unsustainable for my long-term health.
I needed a release valve.

With agreement from everyone at work, and encouragement from David and Camilla, I’m going to start working from home one day a week.
I have a nice home office, and our project is set up to support remote development.
I’m very lucky – from a practical standpoint, it’s easy for me to work from home.

The primary benefit is that I’ll spend less time commuting, and just the free time I get back is significant.
It’ll probably be a mixture of Tuesdays and Thursdays, so it breaks up my remaining commutes as well.
(I’d prefer not to do Mondays or Fridays, so I can bookend the working week in the office, and one of my few fixed meetings is weekly planning on Wednesdays.)

Wellcome is an open office, which I know some people find harder to work in.
I don’t usually feel like an open office is a problem for me, so the quiet working space is less of a benefit – but it’s another reason to consider working from home.
