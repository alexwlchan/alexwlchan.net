One of the last things I did at Wellcome Collection was writing a story about hyperfocus and how it affects my cross-stitch.
I'm really proud of this one, and I hope you'll consider reading.

Writing for Stories was one of my "bucket list" items while working at Wellcome, and I actually submitted the pitch on the same night I decided to start looking for new jobs.
It's among the more personal things I've written, but I'm really pleased with the result.
I'm incredibly grateful to Alice White (my editor) and Steven Pocock (who took the photographs) who helped turn my rough idea into something great, and a nice capstone for my time at Wellcome.

There are photos of several of my finished or in-progress pieces in the article, which come from a variety of artists:

*   *The World is Quiet Here* is a reference to the Lemony Snicket books, and [the pattern is by NeatoBurritoStitches](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1203491391/a-series-of-unfortunate-events-lemony).
*   *Vintage Clothes not Vintage Values* is [a pattern by HappySlothPatterns](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/862043025/vintage-clothes-not-vintage-values-cross).
    I changed the tint colour from a soft pink to a vibrant green, to match the frame I’m planning to use.
*   The black cat in the plants is one of [a set of patterns by SamXstitch](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1244615562/funny-cats-cross-stitch-pattern-home), and I'm working my way through the rest now.
*   The close-up stitching on black aida is from *Silver Needle* by perennial favourite Mathysphere, and was published [in XStitch Magazine](https://xstitchmag.com/space-cross-stitch/).

You can read the story [on the Wellcome Collection website](https://wellcomecollection.org/articles/ZRrH3RIAACIAALP5).
