title: Testing JavaScript without a (third-party) framework
summary: The browser can be a pretty good place to run your JavaScript tests.

Last week Julia Evans posted [Writing Javascript without a build system], and it resonated with my own experience.
A lot of my websites (including this one) are content sites with just a bit of interactivity sprinkled on top, where I prefer writing vanilla JS over using complex build setups. 
Even her 400-line `script.js` would be large by my standards!

One advantage of writing vanilla JS is that it's easy to return to a project after a long break -- you can start editing the JS file straight away, without recreating your build system first.

But whenever I do this, I'm nervous about breaking something.
If it's been months or years since I worked on this code, I've forgotten how it works, and I could easily introduce a new bug.

On larger projects, I have test suites to act as my safety net.
I make a change, I re-run the tests, and they'll tell me if I've broken anything.
But how do I do this with vanilla JavaScript?

I've used a variety of JavaScript test frameworks in work projects, including Jest, Jasmine, and Karma -- but using them has similar problem to build systems.
They all expect to be installed through npm and invoked from the command-line.
If I want to run those tests again after a long period away, I need to recreate my working environment.

I've built myself a tiny framework that lets me write unit tests for my vanilla JS files.
Unlike build systems, where the benefits are marginal for smaller projects, a good test suite can be useful for even the smallest bits of code.
I added some basic filters [to my book tracker](https://books.alexwlchan.net) last year, and although the core logic is only ~50 lines of code, writing some tests helped me spot several bugs I'd missed.

## My secret trick: use the browser

Whenever you run tests, you need to run code -- and browsers are very good at running JavaScript!

I've written a couple of helper functions that let me write test cases in an HTML file, and then view the result in a browser.
Here's an example of what a single test case looks like:

```html
<script>
  it('createPublicationYearLabel: a range of years', () => {
    assertEqual(
      createPublicationYearLabel({ afterYear: '2001', beforeYear: '2002' }),
      'published between 2001 and 2002'
    );
  });
</script>
```

When I open that file in a browser, it runs the test -- and the corresponding JavaScript.
It then puts the results in the body of the document, so I can quickly see whether anything's broken:

{%
  picture
  filename="test_results.png"
  width="504"
  alt="Screenshot of a web browser showing a series of test results. Each test result is a single line, either with a green tick (pass) or a red cross (fail) and a one-line description of what's being tested."
%}

Here a test is failing because it relies on the value of the current year, and I haven't updated the test since 2022 -- but I can see everything else is working.

Let's see what's going on here.

## A function to test: createPublicationYearLabel

In my book tracker, I can filter by the year in which books were published -- for example, if I want to see all the older books I've read, or what my favourites were from this year's new books.
The filter allows you to enter a lower bound, an upper bound, or both:

{%
  picture
  filename="publication_year_filters.png"
  width="410"
  class="screenshot"
  alt="A popover window labelled 'publication year' and the text 'published between [year] and [year]'. Both the '[year]'s are input fields where a user can type some text."
%}

Once I've entered a filter, I have a function `createPublicationYearLabel` which turns it into a human-readable label.

```javascript
createPublicationYearLabel({ beforeYear: 2001 });
// "published before 2001"

createPublicationYearLabel({ beforeYear: 2001, afterYear: 1990 });
// "published between 1990 and 2001"

createPublicationYearLabel({ afterYear: 2023 });
// "published in 2023"
```

This is a bit more complicated than <code>`published between ${lowerBound} and ${upperBound}`</code>, because both bounds are optional -- a simple string template would lead to `'published between 2001 and undefined'`.

There's other logic to handle the case where the lower/upper bounds are the same (I'm looking for books published in a single year) or the lower bound is the current year (I'm looking for new books).

This is a [pure function], and so it's the easiest sort of function to test.
This is typical of the sort of thing I test in vanilla JS -- a function to manipulate some data in a moderately fiddly way, but not doing anything too large or fancy.

## Actually writing the test cases

This is a complete HTML file that runs two tests for this function:

```html
<meta charset="utf-8">

<script src="code_to_test.js"></script>

<script src="test_micro_framework.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="test_micro_framework.css">

<script>
  it('createPublicationYearLabel: a range of years', () => {
    assertEqual(
      createPublicationYearLabel({ afterYear: '2001', beforeYear: '2002' }),
      'published between 2001 and 2002'
    );
  });

  it('createPublicationYearLabel: a single year', () => {
    assertEqual(
      createPublicationYearLabel({ afterYear: '2001', beforeYear: '2001' }),
      'published in 2001'
    );
  });
</script>
```

The [character encoding] in `<meta charset="utf-8">` makes the tick/cross characters look nice in the rendered output.

Then I load the file which contains the functions I want to test, and the helpers functions/styles for my testing framework.

Finally, I define my test cases in a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag, creating a new test case by calling the `it()` function.
This function takes two arguments: a string which describes the test, and a callback function which contains the body of the test.
When I open this file in a browser, the test cases get run in order, and the results appear in the rendered document.

Let's see how that `it()` function works, by looking in `test_micro_framework.js`:

```javascript
function it(description, body_of_test) {
  const result = document.createElement('p');
  result.classList.add('test_result')

  try {
    body_of_test();
    result.classList.add('success');
    result.innerHTML = description;
  } catch (error) {
    result.classList.add('failure');
    result.innerHTML = `${description}<br/><pre>${error}</pre>`;
  }

  document.body.appendChild(result);
}

function assertEqual(x, y) {
  if (
    x === y || (
      typeof x === 'object' &&
      typeof y === 'object' &&
      x.length === y.length &&
      x.every((element, index) => element === y[index])
    )
  ) {
    return;
  } else {
    throw new Error(`${x} != ${y}`);
  }
}

function assertTrue(x) {
  assertEqual(x, true);
}

function assertFalse(x) {
  assertEqual(x, false);
}
```

The `it()` function wraps the body of the test in a `try … catch` block.
If the block succeeds, the test passes; if the block throws an exception, the test fails.
To show me the result, it creates a new `<p>` element and inserts it in the body of the document.
Here's an example of what a successful/failed test look like in the HTML it creates:

```html
<p class="test_result success">
  createPublicationYearLabel: published before
</p>

<p class="test_result failure">
  createPublicationYearLabel: current year<br>
  <pre>Error: published after 2022 != published in 2022</pre>
</p>
```

The reason I'm inserting HTML instead of using console logging (even though I can do [formatting in the console]({% post_url 2023/2023-02-16-css-formatting-in-the-console %})) is that it's just a bit easier to see -- I only need a browser, I don't access to dev tools.
I haven't written much JavaScript on my phone, but it is occasionally useful.

I've also written a couple of assertion helpers, like you get in a proper test framework.

The test results are then styled with a smidgen of CSS in `test_micro_framework.css`, which just adds a splash of colour and the tick/cross symbol:

```css
.test_result {
  margin: 0;
}

.success { color: green; }
.failure { color: red;   }

.success::before { content: '✔ '; }
.failure::before { content: '✘ '; }
```

This is the entirety of my test framework (if you can even call it that!).

This isn't an original idea -- I'm sure I've read articles about similar techniques, and while researching this post I even discovered QUnit, a test framework that [can run in the browser][qunit].

The reason I didn't use any existing solutions (or even think to look for them) is because this was a comparatively simple problem.
The vanilla JS I write isn't complicated, and it doesn't need a complicated test framework.
I probably took less than 10 minutes to write this framework, if you can even call it that.
But it does the job -- it's caught several bugs, and it gives me peace of mind when I return to long-forgotten projects.
