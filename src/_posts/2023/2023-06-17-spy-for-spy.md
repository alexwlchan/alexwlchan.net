Last night I went to see the second preview of [*Spy For Spy*][sfs], which I very much enjoyed.
It's a romance story with a clever narrative twist – it’s being told in the wrong order.

---

Aside from the prologue and epilogue, the show is split into six scenes from the Molly and Sarah’s relationship.
These scenes aren't shown in chronological order; instead they were shown in a random order chosen by the audience before curtain up.
Tonight it opened with a date in a yurt, an argument before dinner, and we didn't see their first meeting until the second half of the play.

    I missed the selection of the order, but I gather people were invited to pick six songs out of a hat, and each song corresponds to one of the scenes from the play.
    Savannah, Sacramento, living rom, Napa, Carmel, and bedroom.

I like the idea, and it worked for me. It put me in mind of Nick Payne’s *Constellations*; both plays that experiment with non-linear narratives to present new takes on love.

I’ve seen several plays that benefit from multiple viewings – once to experience it fresh, once to see how it builds to the ending.
Mixing up the order within a single show gave me a bit of both.
For example, there are several moments in the meet-cute that wouldn’t have stood out if I hadn’t already seen the callbacks in earlier scenes.
(Why does Sarah keep checking her watch?)

It’s rare to see a two-hander with two women, and a sapphic romance rarer still.
The actors grasp the opportunity with both hands, and they did a great job -- I got a distinct sense of the two characters and their different personalities.
Olive Gray plays the free-thinking actor; Amy Lennox plays the anxious, uptight lawyer.

Their chemistry felt genuine, and I was hooked throughout.
One thing they did particularly well was switching demeanours – one scene they’re bickering partners, another they're complete strangers.
The play only works if we feel the non-chronological narrative, and the acting helps sell it.

There are other ways the show marks the different scenes. Small changes of costume, lighting, props. Several times, I had a sense of the new scene before the actors even said a word.

If I have a criticism, it’s that some of the transitions felt slow and unpolished.
The scenes themselves are carefully directed and coordinated, but it dropped in the moments in-between.
The lighting and sound gave the transitions a distinct look and feel, and it’s a shame that wasn’t matched by the on-stage movements.

There are moments of levity and humour – not laugh-a-minute funny, but enough to offset the more sombre tone of certain scenes.
It also gets meta at moments (like a conversation about playing album tracks in the wrong order), and I wonder if the play could lean into this more – at times it felt a bit timid about acknowledging its novel structure.

I had no idea what to expect, but I like what I got.
This was only the second preview, but it's already in pretty good shape.

This isn’t a fluffy romance with perfect people.
Sarah and Molly are messy characters with insecurities and flaws, and that feels like a key through line of the play.

Some aspects of their personality are constant, regardless of the order of events or the challenges they face.
Maybe that's what the play means – love is about finding somebody who sees those imperfections, who can see past your facade, and will make the time for you anyway.
They both talk about wanting to change for one another, but maybe love is about finding somebody who doesn't need you to change.

Or perhaps it means something completely different.
I expect to be thinking about this play for a while, and I hope it has a long future ahead of it (but I didn't want to delay publishing this review).

I went to the show based on a single line of description – “a romantic comedy told in the wrong order” – and it delivered on that promise. 
It's a clever piece of writing that demands you pay attention, and if you do, that attention is richly rewarded.
I want to see it again, and to see how it feels when I see it in a different order.
If you like romance and smart writing, you should see it too.
