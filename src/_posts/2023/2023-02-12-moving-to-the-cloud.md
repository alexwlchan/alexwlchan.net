title: How moving to the cloud took our digital collections to new heights
summary: Building our own platform allowed us to make decisions based on whatâ€™s best for the collections, and not the limitations of our digital infrastructure.

I've written [another article] about digital preservation at Wellcome Collection, this time about the benefits of moving our data storage and processing to the cloud.
Building out this infrastructure is a large part of what I've been working on for the last six (!) years.

It's been really important to me that everyone I work with understands the move to the cloud -- not just the software engineers.
It doesn't have to be a detailed understanding, but I want people to at least get the general direction of travel and see why it's a good idea.
Too often "cloud" is used as this vague and nebulous term, and lots of people feel confused and excluded.

This post is part of that work -- it frames the benefits of a cloud migration in terms of collections management, not technical architecture.
There have been technical wins, but here I'm focusing on better preservation workflows, storing higher-quality files, and removing human bottlenecks.
