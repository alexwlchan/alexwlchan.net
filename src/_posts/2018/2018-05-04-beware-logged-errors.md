Yesterday, Twitter [wrote a blog post][twitter] about a recent security bug:

> When you set a password for your Twitter account, we use technology that masks it so no one at the company can see it. We recently identified a bug that stored passwords unmasked in an internal log. We have fixed the bug, and our investigation shows no indication of breach or misuse by anyone.

Quite by chance, I spent yesterday fixing a similar bug.
I was a bit careless when using the [subprocess module][subprocess], and leaked some AWS credentials into a public CI log.

<!-- summary -->

## The faulty code

Here's a snippet from one of our CI scripts:

```python
import shlex
import subprocess


def ecr_login():
    """Authenticates for pushing to ECR."""
    command = subprocess.check_output([
        'aws', 'ecr', 'get-login', '--no-include-email'
    ]).decode('ascii')
    subprocess.check_call(shlex.split(command))
```

This is part of a script that builds a Docker image, then pushes that image to ECR, a container registry in AWS.
Using [*aws ecr get-login*][get-login] gives us a *docker login* command we can use to authenticate with ECR.
We run that command, and then we can push images to ECR.

The *docker login* command we're about to run includes a password, so we don't want to log that anywhere -- but we aren't logging it, right?

Right?

But I'd forgotten that when the command run by *check_call* or *check_output* fails, you get a CalledProcessError -- **and tracebacks for CalledProcessError include the command you were trying to run**.
This is helpful if you're trying to debug something, but risky if your command contains something sensitive.

So when the *docker login* call flaked out, we got the following traceback in our [public CI logs][cilog]:

```

```

And suddenly anybody has a password that can push images to our ECR repositories.

We were lucky -- the build failure sent us an email, and we were able to delete the compromised credentials pretty quickly.
We followed up with a complete rebuild, so if somebody *did* push a malicious image to ECR, it was quickly replaced.

There are two approaches you could use to prevent making the same mistake.

## Use low-level subprocess APIs

One approach is to eschew the *check_call* and *check_output* APIs, use lower-level subprocess features, and do the error checking yourself.

For example, for *check_call*:

```python
rc = subprocess.call(sensitive_command)
if rc != 0:
    raise RuntimeError('The sensitive command failed!')
```

And to replicate *check_output*:

```python
proc = subprocess.Popen(sensitive_command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
stdout, _ = proc.communicate()

if proc.returncode != 0:
    raise RuntimeError("The sensitive command failed!")
```

## Catch the CalledProcessError

You could use `try â€¦ except` to catch the CalledProcessError, and raise a different exception:

```python
# Python 2 only
try:
    subprocess.check_call(sensitive_command)
except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
    raise RuntimeError("The sensitive command failed!")
```

If you run this code in Python 3, you'll get a nasty surprise.
Because of the new [exception chaining][chaining], the traceback for the RuntimeError includes both exceptions -- including the CalledProcessError we're trying to hide:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "foo.py", line 4, in <module>
    subprocess.check_call(['less', '/dev/null'])
  File "/usr/local/Cellar/python/3.6.4_4/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/subprocess.py", line 291, in check_call
    raise CalledProcessError(retcode, cmd)
subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '['less', '/dev/null']' returned non-zero exit status 1.

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "foo.py", line 6, in <module>
    raise RuntimeError("The sensitive command failed!")
RuntimeError: The sensitive command failed!
```

If we want to suppress the original error, we need to [add `from None` to our `raise` statement][suppress]:

```python
# Python 3 only
try:
    subprocess.check_call(sensitive_command)
except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
    raise RuntimeError("The sensitive command failed!") from None
```

And now only the RuntimeError will be printed.
