title: Keeping track of my book recommendations
summary: The three lists I use to manage my book recommendations.
tags: reading

I have a text file where I write down every book recommendation I receive.
It has three lists:

1.  **Personal recommendations.**
    Anything recommended specifically to me -- usually from somebody who knows my reading tastes, so there's a good chance this will be a book I enjoy.

2.  **General recommendations from friends.**
    Any recommendations from somebody I trust, but not specifically to me -- for example, somebody tweeting "I really enjoyed this book and you should all read it".
    I enjoy a lot of the same books as my friends, but this is a softer recommendation.
    I feel less obliged to follow up on these.

3.  **Everything else.**
    Recommendations from retweets, strangers at parties, people I don't know very well, stuff I saw while browsing in Waterstones, and so on.
    These are mostly valuable in the aggregate -- a single recommendation for a book isn't very useful, but knowing that six different people recommended it might be.

I've tried slicing in other ways -- fiction and non-fiction, by author, genre, date, and so on -- but sorting by quality of recommendation is the one that I keep going back to.

A lot of what I read comes from these lists.
(I have similar lists for films and TV shows.)
I'm not bound by the list, and a bit of spontaneity is helpful to avoid an echo chamber effect â€“ but using it as a starting point means I know I'm likely to enjoy something before I pick it up.

As a bonus, having this list means that if I read something and enjoy it, I get to go back and thank the person who gave me the recommendation.
Sometimes it's years later, but better late than never!

This blog post is the expanded version of that thought.
