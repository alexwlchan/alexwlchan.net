title: Do Not Distract while driving
summary: I've been using Apple Maps for a lot of navigation recently, and run into screens which seem dangerously distracting.

Here's a screen I encounter while driving in Apple Maps, with worrying regularity:

<figure style="max-width: 200px;">
  <img src="/images/2018/apple_maps.png" alt="A screenshot of Apple Maps with two routes labelled ('3 min slower', 'Similar ETA') and a third highlighted, and two buttons ('Resume' and 'End Route').">
  <figcaption>
    I've deliberately made the image small.
    Can you guess why?
  </figcaption>
</figure>

I'm driving along, using turn-by-turn directions, and suddenly this route picker pops up instead.

This is a pretty dangerous distraction.

There's lots of information on the screen, which means I have to look away from the road to read and understand it.
Ideally I'd pull over (which is how I got this screenshot), but that isn't always possible.
The text is small -- less than 2mm high on my iPhone SE -- which makes it slower to read.
And it's taken away my instructions, and distracted me from actually driving.

When you're driving, even a momentary lapse in concentration can be dangerous, even fatal.
I'd love to see this screen go away in iOS 12.

(My phone is a few years old, and I think it gets confused about when I'm moving.
I wonder if the screen is only meant to appear when you're stationary, and my phone makes bad guesses about when I've stopped.)
