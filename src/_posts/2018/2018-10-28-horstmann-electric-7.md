The clocks went back last night, which means changing the clock on my appliances.
One of my few remaining appliances that has a clock but no Internet connection is the timer on my boiler.
It's a new boiler (I moved in June), so I've never had to set the clock on it before.

It turns out it selected the correct winter/summer setting itself, but it's drifted by twenty minutes, so I decided to set it anyway.

This is the timer on my boiler:

    My boiler is in a utility cupboard next to my front door.
    When I turn on the hot water boost, I put the post-it note on the cupboard door, so I don&rsquo;t leave it on when I go out.

The name on the bottom right says "Horstmann Electronic 7", so I did the obvious thing and googled "set clock horstmann electronic 7 boiler".

It took me several minutes to find the answer -- in the [user guide for the timer](https://www.electricity.gg/media/55497/Horstmann-User-Guide.pdf) -- so for the sake of future!me and other Googlers, here are the instructions for setting the clock.
Unless you have this exact appliance, you can stop reading.

<!-- summary -->

This is a diagram showing the front of the timer:

To set the clock:

1.  Press the green "SET" button until the left-hand indicator points to "CLOCK".
    The hour should start to flash.

2.  Adjust the hour with the "MINUS"/"PLUS" buttons.
    It wraps around for AM/PM as appropriate.

3.  Press the blue "SELECT" button to confirm the hour.
    The minute should now start to flash.

4.  Adjust the minute with the "MINUS/PLUS" buttons.
    It wraps from 60 to 0 and vice versa.

5.  Press the blue "SELECT" button a second time to confirm the minute, and to finish.
