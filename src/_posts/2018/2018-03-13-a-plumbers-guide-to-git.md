On Tuesday, I ran my workshop *A Plumber's Guide to Git* for [the Cambridge Python User Group][meetup].
I've also run it [at PyCon UK][pyconuk] and in my workplace.
On all three occasions, it's been very popular and I've heard people find it useful -- on Tuesday, we actually ran out of space in the room!
In an attempt to make it more accessible, I've written up the entire workshop and posted it on my site.

[meetup]: https://www.meetup.com/CamPUG/events/246459416/
[pyconuk]: http://2017.pyconuk.org/sessions/workshops/a-plumber-s-guide-to-git/

The aim of the workshop is to understand of the underlying concepts of Git.
We learn exactly what happens in a typical Git workflow (`add`, `branch`, `commit`, and so on).
We look inside the `.git` directory, and explain what Git stores internally to make those workflows happen.

If that sounds interesting to you, start reading [the introduction](/a-plumbers-guide-to-git/), and continue from there.
I've uploaded everything I use in the workshop -- my notes, whiteboard sketches, and exercises.
Typically it takes about two hours to complete.
Enjoy!
