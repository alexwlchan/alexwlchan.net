Given how many people use their smartphones for maps, here's a suggestion for writing travel instructions:

> Searching &lt;name of building&gt; in Google/Apple Maps finds the right place.

or

> Searching &lt;name of building&gt; in Apple Maps takes you to a different street, a better search term is &lt;name of road&gt;.

I used to live somewhere that was mislabelled in Apple Maps, and every time I had visitors, I'd get a phone call from two streets away asking where I *actually* was.
