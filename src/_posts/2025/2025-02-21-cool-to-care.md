I'm sitting in a small coffee shop in Brooklyn.
I have a warm drink, and it's just started to snow outside.
I'm visiting New York to see [*Operation Mincemeat* on Broadway][oppy_mince] -- I was at the dress rehearsal yesterday, and I'll be at the opening preview tonight.
I've seen this show more times than I care to count, and I hope US theater-goers love it as much as Brits.

The people who make the show will tell you that it's about a bunch of misfits who thought they could do something ridiculous, who had the audacity to believe in something unlikely.

That's certainly one way to see it.
The musical tells the [true story] of a group of British spies who tried to fool Hitler with a dead body, fake papers, and an outrageous plan that could easily have failed.
Decades later, the show's creators would mirror that same spirit of unlikely ambition.
[Four friends][SpitLip], armed with their creativity, determination, and a wardrobe full of hats, created a new musical in a small London theatre.
And after a series of transfers, they're about to open the show under the bright lights of Broadway.

But when I watch the show, I see a story about friendship.
It's about how we need our friends to help us, to inspire us, to push us to be the best versions of ourselves.

I see the swaggering leader who needs a team to help him truly achieve.
The nervous scientist who stands up for himself with the support of his friends.
The enthusiastic secretary who learns wisdom and resilience from her elder.

And so, I suppose, it's fitting that I'm not in New York on my own.
I'm here with friends -- dozens of wonderful people who I met through this ridiculous show.

At first, I was just an audience member.
I sat in my seat, I watched the show, and I laughed and cried with equal measure.

After the show, I waited at stage door to thank the cast.
Then I came to see the show a second time.
And a third.
And a fourth.
After a few trips, I started to see familiar faces waiting with me at stage door.
So before the cast came out, we started chatting.

Those conversations became a Twitter community, then a Discord, then a WhatsApp.
We swapped fan art, merch, and stories of our favourite moments.
We went to other shows together, and we hung out outside the theatre.
I spent New Year's Eve with a few of these friends, sitting on somebody's floor and laughing about a bowl of limes like it was the funniest thing in the world.

And now we're together in New York.

Meeting this kind, funny, and creative group of people might seem as unlikely as the premise of *Mincemeat* itself.
But I believed it was possible, and here we are.

I feel so lucky to have met these people, to take this ridiculous trip, to share these precious days with them.
I know what a privilege this is -- the time, the money, the ability to say *let's do this* and make it happen.
How many people can gather a dozen friends for even a single evening, let alone a trip halfway round the world?

You might think it's silly to travel this far for a theatre show, especially one we've seen plenty of times in London.
Some people would never see the same show twice, and most of us are comfortably into double or triple-figures.

Whenever somebody asks *why*, I don't have a good answer.
Because it's fun?
Because it's moving?
Because I enjoy it?
I feel the need to justify it, as if there's some logical reason that will make all of this okay.
But maybe I don't have to.
Maybe joy doesn't need justification.

A theatre show doesn't happen without people who care.
Neither does a friendship.

So much of our culture tells us that it's not cool to care.
It's better to be detached, dismissive, disinterested.
Enthusiasm is cringe.
Sincerity is weakness.
I've certainly felt that pressure -- the urge to play it cool, to pretend I'm above it all.
To act as if I only enjoy something a "normal" amount.

Well, fuck that.

I don’t know where the drive to be detached comes from.
Maybe it's to protect ourselves, a way to guard against disappointment.
Maybe it's to seem sophisticated, as if having passions makes us childish or less mature.
Or perhaps it's about control -- if we stay detached, we never have to depend on others, we never have to trust in something bigger than ourselves.
Being detached means you can't get hurt -- but you'll also miss out on so much joy.

I'm a big fan of being a big fan of things.
So many of the best things in my life have come from caring, from letting myself be involved, from finding people who are a big fan of the same things as me.
If I pretended not to care, I wouldn't have any of that.

Caring -- deeply, foolishly, vulnerably -- is how I connect with people.
My friends and I care about this show, we care about each other, and we care about our joy.

That care and love for each other is what brought us together, and without it we wouldn't be here in this city.
I know this is a once-in-a-lifetime trip.
So many stars had to align -- for us to meet, for the show we love to be successful, for us to be able to travel together.
But if we didn't care, none of those stars would have aligned.

I know so many other friends who would have loved to be here but can’t be, for all kinds of reasons.
Their absence isn't for lack of caring, and they want the show to do well whether or not they’re here.
I know they care, and that's the important thing.
To butcher Tennyson: I think it's better to care about something you cannot affect, than to care about nothing at all.
In a world that's full of cynicism and spite and hatred, I feel that now more than ever.

I'd recommend you go to the show if you haven't already, but that's not really the point of this post.
Maybe you've already seen *Operation Mincemeat*, and it wasn't for you.
Maybe you’re not a theatre kid.
Maybe you aren't into musicals, or history, or war stories.
That’s okay.
I don't mind if you care about different things to me.
(Imagine how boring the world would be if we all cared about the same things!)

But I want you to care about *something*.
I want you to find it, find people who care about it too, and hold on to them.
Because right now, in this city, with these people, at this show?
I'm so glad I did.
And I hope you find that sort of happiness too.
