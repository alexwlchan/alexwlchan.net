title: We all lose when art is anonymised
summary: |
  When art loses its creator, we lose the story behind the image -- a plea for attribution in our endless scroll culture.

One rabbit hole I can never resist going down is finding the original creator of a piece of art.
This sounds simple, but it's often quite difficult.
The Internet is a maze of social media accounts that only exist to repost other people's art, usually with minimal or non-existent attribution.

A popular image spawns a thousand copies, each a little further from the original.
Signatures get cropped, creators' names vanish, and we're left with meaningless phrases like "no copyright intended", as if that magically absolves someone of artistic theft.

Why do I do this?
I've always been a bit obsessive, a bit completionist.
I've worked in cultural heritage for eight years, which has made me more aware of copyright and more curious about provenance.
And it's satisfying to know I've found the original source, that I can't dig any further.

This takes time.
It's digital detective work, using tools like Google Lens and TinEye, and it's not always [easy or possible](https://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/1036-Perceptual-Searches-and-Applied-Heuristics.html).
Sometimes the original pops straight to the top, but other times it takes a lot of digging to find the source of an image.

So many of us have become accustomed to art as an endless, anonymous stream of "content".
A beautiful image appears in our feed, we give it a quick heart, and scroll on, with no thought for the human who sweated blood and tears to create it.
That original artist feels distant, disconected.
Whatever benefit they might get from the "exposure" of your work going viral, they don't get any if their name has been removed first.

I came across two examples recently that remind me it's not just artists who miss out -- it's everyone who enjoys art.

I saw a photo of some traffic lights on Tumblr.
I love their misty, nighttime aesthetic, the way the bright colours of the lights cut through the fog, the totality of the surrounding darkness.
But there was no name -- somebody had just uploaded the image to their Tumblr page, it was reblogged a bunch of times, and then it appeared on my dashboard.
Who took it?

I used Google Lens to find the original photographer: Lucas Zimmerman.
Then I discovered it was part of [a series][1].
And there was [a sequel][2].
I found [interviews][3].
[Context][4].
[Related work][5].
I found all this cool stuff, but only because I knew Lucas's name.

The second example was a silent video of somebody making tiny chess pieces, just captioned "wow".
It was clearly an edit of another video, with fast-paced cuts to make it accommodate a short attention span -- and again with no attribution.
This was a little harder to find -- I had to search several frames in Google Lens before I found [a summary on a Russian website][summary], which had a link to [a YouTube video][chess_yt] by metalworker and woodworker Левша (Levsha).

This video is four times longer than the cut-up version I found, in higher resolution, and with commentary from the original creator.
I don't speak Russian, but YouTube has auto-translated subtitles.
Now I know how this amazing set was made, and I have a much better understanding of the materials and techniques involved.
(This includes the delightful name [Wenge wood][wenge], which I'd never heard before.)

A piece of art is more than just a single image or video.
It's a process, a human story.
When art is detached from its context and creator, we lose something fundamental.
Creators lose the chance to benefit from their work, and we lose the opportunity to engage with it in a deeper way.
We can't learn how it was made, find their other work, or discover how to make similar art for ourselves.

The Internet has done many wonderful things for art, but it's also a machine for endless copyright infringement.
It's not just about generative AI and content scraping -- those are serious issues, but this problem existed long before any of us had heard of ChatGPT.
It's a thousand tiny paper cuts.

How many of us have used an image from the Internet because it showed up in a search, without a second thought for its creator?
When Google Images says "images may be subject to copyright", how many of us have really thought about what that means?
Next time you want to use an image from the web, look to see if it's shared under a license that allows reuse, and make sure you include the appropriate attribution -- and if not, look for a different image.

Finding the original creator is hard, sometimes impossible.
The Internet is full of shadows: copies of things that went offline years ago.
But when I succeed, it feels worth the effort -- both for the original artist and myself.

When I read a book or watch a TV show, the credits guide me to the artists, and I can appreciate both them and the rest of their work.
I wish the Internet was more like that.
I wish the platforms we rely on put more emphasis on credit and attribution, and the people behind art.

The next time an image catches your eye, take a moment.
Who made this?
What does it mean?
What's their story?
