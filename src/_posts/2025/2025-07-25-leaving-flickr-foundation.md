Today was my last day at the [Flickr Foundation](https://www.flickr.org).
At 5pm I closed my laptop, left the office for the last time, and took a quiet walk along Regent's Canal.
I saw an adorable family of baby coots, and a teenage coot who was still a bit fluffy and raggedy around the edges.

I've got another job lined up, but I'm taking a short break before I start.

My new role is still in software engineering, but in a completely different field.
I'm stepping away from the world of libraries, archives, and photography.
I've met some amazing people, and I'm very proud of everything we accomplished in digital preservation and cultural heritage.
I'll always treasure those memories, but I'm also excited to try something new.

For the last few years, I've been among the more senior engineers in my team.
In my next role, I'll be firmly middle of the pack, and I'm looking forward to learning from people who have more wisdom and experience than me.

But first: rest.
