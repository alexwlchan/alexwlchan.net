title: PyCon UK 2017 resources
summary: Slides and links for my PyCon UK 2017 talks/workshops.
---

This post is a signpost to useful resources for my PyCon UK talks/workshops.
I'll update it as I post new resources/links.

*   Talk: [**Using privilege to improve inclusion**](/2017/11/pyconuk-2017-privilege-inclusion/), Friday at 10:30

    I've posted my slides and notes.
    The official video isn't available yet, but I'll post a link on that page when it's up.

*   Workshop: [**A plumber's guide to Git**](/2017/11/a-plumbers-guide-to-git/), Friday at 14:30

    I've posted my exercises and cheat sheet, and the Git Book is a good reference if you want to work through the exercises at home.

*   Lightning talk: **Let's talk about (a)sex(uals)**, Thursday lightning talks

    This was an impromptu lightning talk I gave on Thursday evening.
    I only had one slide:

    <img src="/slides/pyconuk_asexuality.png" style="max-width: 500px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

    The image is taken from [this AVEN thread](http://fr.asexuality.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=7994).
    The talk itself was based on a blog post I wrote at work.
    I'll try to tidy it up and post a link here when that's done.
