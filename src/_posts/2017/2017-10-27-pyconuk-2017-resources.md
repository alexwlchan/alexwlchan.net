A PDF with the workshop exercises will appear shortly.

### Let's talk about (a)sex(uals)

This was an impromptu lightning talk I gave on Thursday evening.
I only had one slide:

The image is taken from [this AVEN thread](http://fr.asexuality.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=7994).
The talk itself was based on a blog post I wrote at work.
I'll try to tidy it up and post a link here when that's done.
