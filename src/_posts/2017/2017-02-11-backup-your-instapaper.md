title: A script for backing up your Instapaper bookmarks
---

About three days ago, there was [an extended outage][outage] at Instapaper.
Luckily, it seems like there wasn't any permanent data loss &ndash; everybody's bookmarks are still safe &ndash; but this sort of incident can make you worry.

I have a Python script that backs up my Instapaper bookmarks on a regular basis, so I was never worried about data loss.
At worst, I'd have lost an hour or so of changes &ndash; fairly minor, in the grand scheme of things.
I've been meaning to tidy it up and share it for a while, and this outage prompted me to get on and finish that.
You can find the script and the installation instructions [on GitHub][github].
