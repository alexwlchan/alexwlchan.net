I collect some basic data about visits to my websites, to help me decide what to write about next.
I gather statistics in aggregate, and I don't collect any information about specific visitors.

For example, I can see that 100 people read a post, but I can't see (a) who those 100 people were or (b) if you were one of them.

## What data I collect

Whenever you visit a page, I use a tracking pixel to record the following anonymised information:

*   The current date
*   The URL and title of the page you were looking at
*   The referrer, i.e. which page linked you to my website
*   The country you're in, which is guessed from your IP address
*   An anonymous session identifier, so I can correlate hits within the same session.
    I use this for counting unique visitors.
    It allows me to see that one person looked at three pages in the row, but I can't see who that person is.
*   The dimensions of your screen (e.g. 1024×768)
*   Whether you're a bot or crawler (based on your User-Agent, so I can separate humans from Google's search crawler)

I **don't** record your IP address or user agent.

## Third parties

I don't share the information I get from my tracking pixel – it only lives on my web server and personal computers.

I use Netlify to host my website, and Linode to host my tracking pixel.
They can see what pages you're visiting, and they have separate privacy policies.
([Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/privacy/); [Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/legal/privacy-statement), who own Linode.)
