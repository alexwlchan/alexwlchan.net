**I'm trying not to track you, and I'm trying to protect you from being tracked by others.**

*   **I collect basic, anonymised visit data.**
    I don't record anything that might allow me to track or identify individuals (in particular, I don't store your IP address or User-Agent header).
    I can see that 100 people read a post, but not who they were or if you were one of them.

    I don't share this data with anybody, and I don't use analytics services like Google Analytics.

*   **Newsletter subscribers:** I only give your email address to [Buttondown](https://docs.buttondown.com/privacy-and-security#gdpr-compliance) (my email service) so they can send newsletters on my behalf.
    I don't share it or use it for anything else.
    You can unsubscribe whenever you like.

*   **YouTube embeds.**
    I use `youtube-nocookie.com` to reduce YouTube's tracking.

*   **I don't use any cookies.**
