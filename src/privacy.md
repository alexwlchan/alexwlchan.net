**tl;dr: I'm trying not to track you, and I'm trying to protect you from being tracked by others.**

*   **I record basic, anonymised data about visits to the website.**
    Neither my server logs nor my visitor statistics record anything that might allow me to track or identify individuals.
    In particular, I don't store your IP address or User-Agent header.

    This means I could, for example, see that 100 people read a post, but I can't see (a) who those 100 people were nor (b) if you were one of them.

    I don't share this data with anybody else.
    I don't use any analytics frameworks that share data with other companies (e.g. Google Analytics, Piwik, or Fathom).

*   **If you subscribe to my newsletter, I only share your email address with [Buttondown](https://docs.buttondown.com/privacy-and-security#gdpr-compliance), so they can send you emails on my behalf.**
    I don't share your email address with anybody else, and I'll only use it to send you my newsletter.
    You can unsubscribe whenever you like.

*   **A small number of articles embed YouTube videos.**
    I use the `youtube-nocookie.com` domain, which reduces the amount of tracking from YouTube.

*   **My websites don't use any cookies.**
