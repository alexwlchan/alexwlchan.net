title: How to set the clock on a Tricity Bendix SIE454 electric cooker
---

The electric cooker in my flat is a Tricity Bendix SIE454, and the clock resets whenever there's a power cut.
These instructions explain how to set the clock.

_**Disclaimer:** I'm not an oven technician, and you follow these instructions at your own risk.
If in doubt, consult your oven manual and/or a certified electrician._

The control panel for my oven is on the upper left-hand side of the front panel:
This is what it looks like:

I use the following steps to reset my clock:

1.  Press **SELECT**.
    This will cycle the indicator around the four outer options (*COOKTIME*, *END TIME*, *COUNTDOWN* and *TIME OF DAY*).

    Continue until *TIME OF DAY* is selected.

2.  Uses the **+**/**&ndash;** buttons to adjust the time.
    The control uses a 24-hour clock that wraps around to the next or previous hour.
    You can hold down the button to change the time more quickly.

3.  The clock is set.
    Press **SELECTOR** to return to finish.
