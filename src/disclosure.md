Everything on this site is my personal opinion and writing, and not approved or endorsed by an employer, past or present.

Since August 2025, I've worked at [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com), where my compensation includes stock options.
Tailscale is the only company in which I hold stock or options (now or in the past).
I might have investments in technology companies as part of my pension funds, but if I do, I don't know what they are or what the pension funds are doing with them.
