These are bits of information that I find useful to keep around, and I post online to seed Google searches (both for other people, and my future self).
Usually stuff that doesn't fit into a blog post, but I want to keep *somewhere*.

Programming and software:

* [Custom CSS and ResophNotes](/notes/custom-css-resophnotes)
* [Some pins for Python&nbsp;2.6](/notes/python-2.6-pins)

Household information:

* [How to set the clock on a Tricity Bendix SIE454 electric cooker](/notes/tricity-sie454-clock)
* [How to set the clock on a Worcester 28CDi boiler](/notes/worcester-28cdi-clock)
