## Social media

I have a limited presence on social media, where I post my "edited highlights" -- links to stuff I've made that I think is particularly interesting or notable.

(I used to be active on Twitter, but I no longer post there.
I also have an Instagram account that I use to follow my friends, but I never post anything.)
