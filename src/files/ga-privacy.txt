# Privacy Policy

> This is the privacy policy I used while I had Google Analytics on the site.  When I started using Piwik for analytics, this policy was archived.  I used GA from May 2014 to August 2015.

Like many websites, I use [Google Analytics][ga] on `alexwlchan.net`.

Google Analytics is a piece of software that records data about visitors to the site (you). It installs a cookie to record basic tracking data.

### What does Google Analytics record?

Google Analytics records a lot of information.
I haven't found an exhaustive list of what it records (I'll post a link here if I find one), but here's the sort of information it tracks:

* How you arrived at my website
* How long you stay for
* What pages you're looking at
* Where you're accessing the site from (geographically)

And a lot more besides.

### What do I do with the data?

The tracking information lets me understand who comes to my site, and what they're interested in.
This is useful when I'm trying to decide what to write about next.

Nobody (including my employer) has ever asked to see, or been shown, the data that I record about this site.
I would expect to challenge such a request if I ever received one.

Everything I do is within the bounds of the [Google Analytics Terms of Service][tos].

Google may also use the data from Analytics. You can read [How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps][goog] on Google's websites for an explanation of their policies.

### Can I opt out of tracking?

Google provides a [browser plugin to opt-out of all Google Analytics tracking][bp].
If you choose to install this, then I don't receive any data about your browsing session.
