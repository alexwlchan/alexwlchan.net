I thought this would be a standard romance, but it actually turned out to be a gorgeous exploration of death and aging and dealing with that as part of your daily life.
Ambroise is an embalmer for the dead; Manelle is a home help for the elderly.

The first half of the book is spent establishing the characters, and the second half was lovely and not what I expected.
Lots of good emotions and feelings!
