This was my favourite book of the series so far -- we see a completely differently silo society again, where everyone is aware of the outside and the other silos.
Maybe the details are wrong, but the broad strokes are correct and they're doing annual runs to gather information about the outside.

The major moments of the plot are fairly predictable; what I enjoyed more was the descriptions of nature.
How would somebody who'd lived their whole life in the silo interact with nature and wildlife when they finally get outside?
This had some thoughtful writing about how they might feel and react.
