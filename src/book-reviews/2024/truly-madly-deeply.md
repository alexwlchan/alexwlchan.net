Another fun romance from one of my favourite authors.
It doesn't stand out to me like some of her previous books, but I still enjoyed it.

Some highlights:

*   Truly is deeply unsure of what she wants (or unwilling to admit it), and a lot of her conversations with Colin are about what she wants out of romance.
    She spent six years ignoring this question because she had a long-term boyfriend Justin, who she stayed with by default even if it's clear there was no spark there.
    I found those conversations very relatable.

*   Explicit bi rep.
    I know this has been in several of her previous books, but it's talked about more here.

*   The playful teasing and sarcastic humour are very much my vibe.

This book has more explicit sex scenes than her previous books, but asking me to review those is like asking a vegan to rate a steak house.
Not really my thing; I skimmed through them and it didn't affect my enjoyment of rest of the book.

A quick and easy read.
