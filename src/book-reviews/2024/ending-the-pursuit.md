The introduction to this book promises some good ideas about the links between queerness and colonialism, but the writing style is so dry and academic that I just bounced off.

It's unclear how much of this book is original research and insight, and how much is cobbled together from elsewhere -- there were a lot of quotes from online interviews and other sources, but very little "first-party" reporting.
I enjoy stories and anecdotes that I can remember, and this was frustratingly vague.
