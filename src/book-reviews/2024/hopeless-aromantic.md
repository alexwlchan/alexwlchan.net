I made it maybe thirty pages into this book before dropping it in disgust.
It feels like a book written by somebody who's never been past the first page of Google search results.

Within the first chapter or so, the author is playing oppression Olympics with the asexual community, and making flimsy claims that several pop history figures could have been aromantic (Jane Austen, Isaac Newton, Florence Nightingale).
Based on the discussion at book club, the rest of book doesn't get any better.

I'm glad there are more books about aromanticism (and books which put the word "aromantic" in the title), but I'm not a fan of this one.
