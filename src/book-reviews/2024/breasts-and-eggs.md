This book failed to grab me.
I found the prose quite literary and draining, and I struggled to motivate myself to keep reading -- I gave up halfway through.

It's two books that were published separately in Japan, translated and packaged together for the English release – the first about a sister who wants to get breast implants, the second about a woman who's looking for a sperm donor.
The two books have similar characters, but I found the transition quite jarring.

This was particularly frustrating because Midoriko, the teenage niece, was the most interesting character of the first book, and she barely gets mentioned in the second.
