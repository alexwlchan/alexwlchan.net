The first-person story of sixteen-year old rapper Bri, who’s trying to start her rapping career and find a way to support her family.
It touches on some heavy issues, but does so deftly, and you get enough to see both perspectives – teenage Bri and the adults around her.
It was a quick and easy read; I finished it in less than a day.

This has been on my TBR pile for ages, and I finally got it from the library.
I’m glad I got round to it!
