A thriller about a woman who sees a girl being kidnapped from a railway station, but nobody else witnesses it.
It's a first-person narration from the point of view of the woman, who's a new mother struggling with mental health issues.

The explanation is maybe telegraphed a little early – I worked out what was going on less than halfway through the book – but it didn't affect my enjoyment.
I was gripped, and the ending felt suitably tense.
