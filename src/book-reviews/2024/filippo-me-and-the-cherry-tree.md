A charming sequel to [*The Distance Between Me and the Cherry Tree*](/book-reviews/the-distance-between-me-and-the-cherry-tree/).
Mafalda is older and now two years into being blind.
She's learnt to adapt to the fog, and is trying to navigate teenage life.

Her character is the same -- her independence, her anxiety, her magical worldview -- but she's facing different problems as a teenager.
Getting through school, her first period, a father who's stuck in a depressive funk, and trying to understand her feelings for Filippo.

It's short and sweet.
