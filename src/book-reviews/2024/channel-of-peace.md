I saw *Come From Away* on its UK tour in November, so I wanted to read more of the details behind the story.
It goes into more detail than the musical, and covers parts of Kevin's journey that were new to me -- like Newfoundlanders offering a ride in their car, or the return to Paris after US airspace reopened.

The later chapters describe his campaign to do good deeds on the anniversary of 9/11, his spiritual reawakening in the years following, and watching the story be adapted into a musical.

It's short, sweet, and a nice amount of additional colour on the story.
