Easy high point of the *Silo 49* series.

In [the previous book](/book-reviews/silo-49-dark-till-dawn/), Lizbet was mentioned as Greg's former flame, who died many years prior and whose memory still haunts him.
It's implied that she was a social outcast -- years later, Lillian's knows her as "Elizabeth the Other" -- but is light on detail.

This book gives us that detail.
We see the final hours of Lizbet's life, the escape of dancing in the club at 25 Drums, the arrest of her father and her social ostracisation, Greg as her wallflower.
Her calmly walking up the stairs after everyone has left the club, and getting to fly.

Lizbet is a girl who was let down by society.
After three books showing how society can improve, this novella shows how the spectre of the "Other" can make this silo a hell for Lizbet.
I felt instant sympathy for her, and I cried when she went over the rails.
(As I was getting off a train, no less.)

This is the dark side of Silo 49, and the writing is as lyrical as the subject matter is grim.
