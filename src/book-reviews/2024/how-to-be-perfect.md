This is a gentler book about moral philosophy and ethics than most academic texts, and peppered with little jokes and references to *The Good Place*, but still not enough to hold my attention.
I picked it up because I enjoyed the show, but it turns out I'm not quite interested enough in ethics to read a whole book about it.
