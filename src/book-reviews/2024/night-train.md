This book had an intriguing premise: a woman wakes up on a moving train, with no memory of who she is or how she got there.
As she explores the train, she meets other people who've lost their memories.
The train is traversing a ruined Earth, in a loop not dissimilar to the premise of *Snowpiercer*.

There are several interludes where we jump back to before the train, and see events in the world that led to the dystopia present.

It fell short of my hopes -- I struggled to follow how the pieces fitted together, and it felt like a lot of parts were unexplained.
There were monsters and schools and weapons… just because.
I think there's a political message in here about power and corruption, but I didn't get it.
I read it quickly and was somewhat interested to find the resolution, but I didn't love it.
