This is a romance novel about a woman having her lesbian awakening while dealing with severe depression and mental health issues.

I struggled to get into it and almost gave up several times, but it picks up in the middle and I got a lot of warm and fuzzy feelings from the ending.
There are a lot of nice moments at the end where she and her new girlfriend profess their love for each other; she makes a heartwarming speech; they get their happily ever after.
