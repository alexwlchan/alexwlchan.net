Historical fiction which is loosely based on the Hongwu Emperor, with some light fantasy thrown in.
In this retelling, the emperor is actually a young girl from a peasant family, who poses as her brother after the rest of her family are killed following a bandit attack.
She becomes a monk, then a military commander, and gradually grows in rank and influence while being more and more ruthless.

It was fine, but I'm not sure I'd have finished the book if I wasn't going to discuss it at book club.
The author has a slightly lyrical style I didn't really enjoy, I didn't find myself rooting for any character in particular, and I was skimming at multiple points.
