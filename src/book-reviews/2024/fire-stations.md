An interesting book about the history of fire brigades in Britain, and the buildings they used, starting from insurance fire brigades in 1666 and through to the modern day.
There are lots of photos alongside the text.

This is closer to "pop history" than an academic tome, which is the right level for me.
Enough detail for me to learn some new stuff, not so much that I get bogged down.
