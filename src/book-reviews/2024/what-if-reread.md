I re-read this as a palate cleanser while visiting my parents; they had a copy on the shelf.
Fun and interesting, but I've read enough of this that's been syndicated elsewhere that I remembered a lot of the material.

I'm only ever reading one book at a time; I don't read multiple books at once.
When I get stuck on a book, it slows me down until it's finished.
My [previous book](/book-reviews/how-to-be-a-normal-person/) was one where I got a bit stuck; I'm hoping following it with one I could read quickly (<12 hours) will give me some speed I can carry into my next book.
