This is a series of fairy tales in which the author saw their own asexuality, but the tales are presented sans commentary.

I found it difficult to get into, because clearly the author and I have different experiences of being ace, and it wasn't immediately obvious how the stories were meant to resonate.
When we discussed it at Ace Book Club, I started to see some of it, but it was hard work and would have been easier if the author had explained "this is why I like this story and how I see myself in it".

I only read about half the stories, because most of them washed over me.
They were too short to connect with the characters.

Props for including stories from a variety of sources, and not just the traditional Western canon.
