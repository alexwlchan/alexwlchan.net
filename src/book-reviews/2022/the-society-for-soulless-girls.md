This was a fun and quick read: Alice and Lottie are students at a newly-reopened school famous for a string of mysterious deaths.
The book alternates between their points of view, as Lottie becomes possessed by a dark force and Alice splits her soul in an ill-fated ritual – drawing them into the dark history of the school.

I like the overall plot, which is really about male attitudes to women's anger; it hangs together nicely as a theme.

Some elements felt a little underdeveloped – like the romance between the two protagonists – and the ending came together quite quickly.

I enjoyed it, but I didn't love it.
