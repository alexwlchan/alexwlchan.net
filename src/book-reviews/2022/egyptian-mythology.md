I got this from a second-hand book store on a whim; upon trying to read it I realised I'm not as interested as I thought it was.
It's an in-depth discussion of Egyptian religious beliefs and their gods, but my eyes were glossing over the details.
I realised I wouldn't get anything more from trying to finish it.

It's not a bad book, but not one for me.
