This is an anthology of essays about different people's experiences of gender, focusing on a sense of joy rather than despair.
It's lovely to see such a variety of perspectives on gender, and to see how even tiny moments can bring such happiness.

I really enjoyed getting the different perspectives, some of which resonate closely with me, others which are very different.
I like that it has a diverse selection of authors, in many dimensions -- not just white, binary, trans women.

Particular favourite essays were "Gender-Creative Parenting", "The First Signs Hormones Were Working for Me", and "Punks Against Gender Conformity".
