An interesting book about outrage on social media, and why it's more noise than doing anything useful.
A first-person perspective from somebody who's seen the impotence of so-called "clicktivism".

It's fine; I didn't pick up any new ideas because I've seen a lot of it myself or through my friends, but interesting to read somebody else's take on things I've been thinking.
If you've been on the other side of a Twitter pile-on and you're not using it as a marketing tool, I think you learn this stuff fast.

This was another  gift from Mum, although I don't remember when.
