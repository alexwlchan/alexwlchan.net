A fun, gripping novel about a seaside mystery.
Who created a museum in a smuggler's house devoted to Emily, a girl who disappeared along with her sister nearly twenty years ago?

The book alternates between Lily (in the present day) and Emily (twenty years ago).
The plot is clear and easy-to-follow, and the characters are consistent if a little simplistic.

I read this in two sittings, and I couldn't put it down.
I got chills -- literal chills, in a heatwave -- at some of the dramatic moments, and I kept looking over my shoulder for the man in the dark coat.
Even now I'm done, I still feel some of the tension.

This was a gift from Ed for my 29th birthday; it's a good book.
