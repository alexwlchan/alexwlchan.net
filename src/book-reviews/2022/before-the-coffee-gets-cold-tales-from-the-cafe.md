This is a charming little book about a café in which you can travel in time.
You sit in a chair, drink your coffee, and you can go and meet people from your past and future.
But remember the rules -- you can't change what happens, you can't get up from your chair, and you can't stay beyond a single cup of coffee.

There are four people who travel back and forth, and a fifth story of the proprietors of the café.
They're nice stories of emotion, heartbreak, and love.

Apparently this is the middle book in a series; I picked it up on a whim, but I'll definitely be seeking out the others.
