This is a really fun book about colour – there's a brief intro about colour in general, then a variety of shades each get a page or two describing their history, manufacture, cultural attitudes, and more.
Unlike some list-like books, I enjoyed reading this one.
There were lots of engaging, interesting facts that kept me reading.

I could only read so much at a time; the regular breaks made it hard to keep focus, but I enjoyed it when I did read it.

The physical book is also a gorgeous object.
The cover is bright and colourful, and each page has an outer border to match the colour it's describing.
