I started listening to this because it's been recommended several times on *The Incomparable*.
It's an alternative history in which a meteorite crashes in the 1950s, kicking off a much more ambitious and expansive space programme.
The book centres around Elma, a mathematician and WWII pilot who's disgruntled at the way women have been excluded from the new astronaut programme.

It seems like something I should like, but it just failed to grab me.
I was a third of the way through, and not feeling it, so I stopped.

This is part of a series, and the in-universe and publication order are different.
I might try revisiting this or the first published book at some point, but for now I'm putting it down.
