A book about having better conversations, based on the author's experience as a journalist and interviewer.

There's a mixture of advice and anecdotes, with the stories sprinkled throughout to provide some colour to the theory.
I like that stories about the author are usually not what to do (and aware of that fact!); stories about other people only paint that person in a complimentary light.
It's a good balance.

It covers a bunch of topics, including attention span, active listening, and how to ask good questions.
I didn't think any of the insight was especially novel, but having it presented in one go helps emphasise the key points.

It was a quick, easy read that I can imagine returning to for a reminder of the key points.
