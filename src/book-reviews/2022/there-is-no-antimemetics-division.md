My head hurts.

This is a book in the same universe as the [SCP Foundation], built around the concept of "anti-memes" -- ideas that literally can't stay in your head.
This in itself is a clever if somewhat mind-bending idea.

I thought the book was going to be a collection of disconnected stories of anti-memetic phenomena.
The Foundation agent who forgets they work in antimemetics.
A malicious entity that eats your memories and then other people's memories of you.
A pet antimeme that has to be fed trivia and useless facts.

But actually, there are longer plots, the main one being a superlative force that devours anything that remembers it -- which makes it quite hard to counter.
Most of my headspace was taken up thinking about SCP-3125, and I still don't fully understand what happened.

Regardless, I very much enjoyed it as a piece of worldbuilding, and really pushing a concept.
A good mix of horror and intrigue.
