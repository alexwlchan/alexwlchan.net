I've had this on my shelf for a while; it covers a bunch of stuff about theoretical physics, fundamental forces, quantum mechanics, and so on.
Mostly ideas I've encountered before, and a fairly light covering of all of them -- nothing too challenging or technical.

It's fine; I'm glad to have finished it but I have no strong feelings.
