Interesting book about the history of the RNLI, set before a lot of modern developments -- motorised lifeboats are still a curiosity, plastic isn't really a thing yet, radios are just starting to appear.

It mentions a bunch of people and incidents that I hadn't heard of before (including several which don't seem to be mentioned anywhere online).
