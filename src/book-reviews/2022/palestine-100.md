A dozen short stories from Palestinian writers imagining life a century after [the Nakba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba), an event in 1948 that saw the destruction of Palestine and displacement of most Palestian Arabs.
It's an intriguing premise, and used to explore a variety of science fiction tropes – virtual reality, dystopian surveillance, transhumanism and the nature of memory.

I know very little about Palestinian history or politics, but that didn't stop me enjoying the book.

Inevitably, I liked some of the stories more than others – my particular favourites were *Vengeance* and *Application 39* – but I didn't dislike any of them.
It's a good mix of ideas and themes, and I can see myself returning to some of the stories again.

I originally heard of this book in [a tweet from Rae](https://twitter.com/RaeKnowler/status/1147071054336208896).
