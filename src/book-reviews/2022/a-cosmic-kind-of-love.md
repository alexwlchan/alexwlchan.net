A fun little romance I borrowed from the library.
Standard light reading.

It follows a pretty predictable formula: a meetcute, they're friends with feelings, they start dating, some conflict, then it gets resolved.

Chris's story is kinda interesting – he's a Mexican-American astronaut who doesn't know much about his heritage, because his father won't talk about it.
He feels conflicted, because he's held up as a poster boy for diversity by NASA.

A pleasant read but nothing special.
