This is a series of advice to a young mathematician at various points in their mathematical career: learning at school, their undergraduate degree, preparing for their PhD, postdoc, and eventually a career in academia.
It's framed as a series of letters to "Meg".

I got this book a long time ago and I don't think I've read it before; it's good.
The advice resonates with my experience, and is clear and well-explained.
(Would I have listened if I'd read it when I was younger? I'm not sure.)

It's also peppered with fun stories and examples that I can appreciate even if I'm not in maths any more.

I enjoyed it as a glimpse of what my life could have been, and it makes me a bit more certain I made the right choice by stepping away.
