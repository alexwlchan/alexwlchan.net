A sort-of fairy tale from the second World War.
Two Jewish parents are being transported with their twin children through a snowy wood, and the father throws his daughter from the train to try to save her life.
The baby is taken in by a woodcutter's wife, and we see the people who do -- or don't -- let the child into their lives.

A beautiful little story of humanity and kindness, in the darkest of times.
