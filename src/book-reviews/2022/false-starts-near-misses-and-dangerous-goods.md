A collection of stories about working on the railways; a lot of it about day-to-day life and work, rather than headline events.
Particular favourites include:

* Somebody who knew the exact term to put in the report when animals strayed onto the line (bovine, ovine, zoological, …)
* Somebody who knew timetables by memory, and told a colleague exactly how to get around the Swiss network on holiday
* A royal train for the Queen – but nobody thought to ask who would push the button for the sliding doors
* The trials of filming *Agatha* (1979) at York station, and an apparant gaffe where an HST appears in a shot
* Driving a car with a lion cub as part of a marketing campaign

It's fun if mostly unremarkable; I was given it by Granddad, but as he suggested it's going to the charity shop now I'm done.
