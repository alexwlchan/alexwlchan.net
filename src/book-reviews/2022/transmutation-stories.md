This was a gift from Mum, and comes recommended from her.
It's a collection of short stories about various transformations -- including a trans man and his father's superstition about changing the name of a boat, an older person who literally disappears from the world, and some form of vampire.

I didn't connect with the stories or the characters; they failed to hook me.
