A fun romance about Nadia and Daniel, who repeatedly almost-meet in a series of coincidences (a shared Tube carriage, a mutual friend, going to the same event).
They initially connect through the medium of *Missed Connections* newspaper ads, but do get their happily ever after.

The plot is barely plausible, but it's fun so I don't mind.

This book wins serendipity points, because Wellcome Collection is mentioned three times -- they both visit the galleries at around the same time, and Nadia sees it on Daniel's Instagram profile.
On a day when I was meant to be on leave!
