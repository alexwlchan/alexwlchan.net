Interesting account of the Mary Celeste mystery; both the people involved in the original incident, and all the speculation that then followed.
The book doesn't offer its own theory about what happened, but instead forms a collection of other people's theories.

I think I picked this up from a charity shop; it was pleasant but unremarkable.
