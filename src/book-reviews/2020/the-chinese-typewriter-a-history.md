This was recommended in a talk at !!Con 2020 about [translating Chinese into Morse code](https://speakerdeck.com/franklinhu/learning-your-ai-bi-xi-s-translating-chinese-into-morse-code?slide=17), accompanied by a [Glitch app for doing the same](https://translate-chinese-into-morse-code.glitch.me/).

Mum gave it to me for my 27th birthday.

I found it quite interesting, and I took a lot of notes.
It goes broadly chronologically -- looking at early attempts to build a Chinese typewriter, then later concepts building on those ideas, and the social and business context it grew into.
(For example, there's a lot of discussion of the schools where people learnt how to use the various Chinese typewriters.)

The book really wants to address a wider topic of "how do you fit Chinese into a world dominated by the Roman alphabet".
The typewriter is one part of this, but there are broader social, political and technical aspects -- and they all get discussed at appropriate points.

Would recommend to anybody interested in languages, particularly Unicode nerds.
