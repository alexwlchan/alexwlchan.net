A selection of articles from *The Magazine*.
I'm not sure if the book has a particular theme, but I spotted two distinct themes in the pieces I liked.

One was hand crafts: cosplay, making clothes, type and printing.
I feel like I don't have anything that's quite on that scale (so much of my life is digital), and I'd like to get there.

The other was places: a desert in Poland, the Yosemite mountains, a massive lava lamp.
It's boosted my sense of wanderlust, no doubt helped by the current lockdown.

I read it cover-to-cover (except John Siracusa's piece about *Journey*, which I still haven't played yet).
It's worth doing once -- it's all good -- but if I pick it up again, it'll probably be to read individual pieces that I remember.
