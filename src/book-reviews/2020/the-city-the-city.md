This was a gift from Mum; bought on the recommendation of [Rae](https://twitter.com/RaeKnowler) and [David](https://twitter.com/zarkonnen_com).

Two European cities, Besźel and Ul Qoma, which occupy the same space but whose residents are careful never to see each other.
The book follows police inspector Tyador Borlú investigating the murder of a foreign student.

I really enjoyed this, and I paced myself reading it to last longer.
Gripping story, fascinating concept, and interesting commentary on how we train ourselves to "unsee" things in the real world.
I definitely want to read more of this author's work.
