Murderbot finds Dr. Mensah, who's being held by GrayCris, breaks her out with the help of some other friends, and gives her the evidence of GrayCris's illegal crimes.

I'm firmly on board with Murderbot now.
Not sure when it happened, but I love this ridiculous killing machine and would happily die for it.

[Comment from Murderbot: why are humans so keen on putting themselves in danger as a show of affection? Are they trying to make my job harder? 🤖]
