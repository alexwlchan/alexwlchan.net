I've had a copy of this on my shelf for years, but it failed to grab me after two chapters.
It has plenty of detail, but apparently I'm not that interested in the invention of the atomic bomb.
I might have one more go at reading it, but I suspect I just don't care enough to read several hundred pages on the topic.
