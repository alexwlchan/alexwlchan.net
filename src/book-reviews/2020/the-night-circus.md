This was originally recommended by [kaberett](https://kaberett.dreamwidth.org/), who really likes it.
I read a couple of chapters at their house, but didn't revisit it for another six months.

The plot is complicated and quite windy -- the titular circus is a travelling event, with elements of real magic and illusion mixed into the spectacle.
The circus is the backdrop for a competition between two students (Celia and Marco), whose mentors set them on a contest of skill and endurance.
Rather than try to summarise more of the plot (see [Wikipedia for that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Circus)), how did it make me feel?

I really enjoyed it.
The imagery and characters are gorgeous, and the mixture of narratives and timelines worked far better than I'd expect.
The book jumps around a lot, and initially I was quite confused -- how do all the strands tie together?
I was expecting to be confused at the end, but in fact I felt like I completely understood it at the end.
That's rare.
The different threads do join up, but in such a subtle way that I barely noticed it happening.

Every scene set in the circus is beautiful, but not at all flashy.
Naturally, I want to pay it a visit if it ever comes to town.
And the characters are thoughtful, well-rounded people -- nobody is a flat caricature or a stereotype.

I'll surely read this again at some point, to spot things I missed on the first readthrough -- in the meantime, this was a fun book to read, and I'm glad I did.
