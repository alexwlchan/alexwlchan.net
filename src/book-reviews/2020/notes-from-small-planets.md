Fun book that imagines tropes from science-fiction and fantasy as different worlds to be explored, and presents them as a travel guide: a world of pirates, a world of D&D characters, *Star Wars* and *Star Trek* mixed into one, and so on.
There are knowing winks to each genre, but it's presented in an original and humorous way.

There's an ongoing discussion in the footnotes between Floyd (the in-universe author) and Eliza (his editor), where she points out what he should and shouldn't say.
It helps tie the chapters together -- we don't get a full story, but flashes of what he's been up to.

Easy to recommend if you want something light to read.

I can't remember where I first heard of the book -- probably Twitter.
I bought it in Waterstones in June.
