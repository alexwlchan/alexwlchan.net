Victorian fiction -- a thief who gets out of prison and creates a new life for himself, funded by a series of burglaries accessed through the sewers.
We follow his attempts to fund and manage his new life as a member of the aristocracy, and avoid detection.
(Yes, Joseph Bazalgette is involved.)

It's fine?
I kept reading to find out what happened, but I don't have a strong attachment to any of the characters, and I wasn't caught up in events.

It's been on my shelf for a long time.
I'm glad I've read it now, but I probably won't read the sequels.
