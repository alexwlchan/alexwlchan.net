A period novel, a one-sided love story set in early twentieth century Cambridge.
The absurdity of Fred's Cambridge life is set against the harsh realities of Daisy's existence, and the two form an unlikely pairing.
The story has some twists and turns, and I enjoyed it -- but I'm not sure I "got" it.
I think there's a deeper theme here, but I didn't get it.
It's only short, so I'll keep it and maybe re-read it sometime.

Side note: I have no idea how I got this book.
I found it in my bedroom in Cheltenham, but I have no memory of receiving it and nor does anyone else.
The world moves in mysterious ways...
