Historical fiction about a young boy living in the Saltee Islands, off the coast of Ireland.
He's born in a hot air balloon, but he gets banished to a prison island after a coup -- the king and his mentor both murdered, and his family and lover told he is dead.
His obsession with flying leads him to build a plane that lets him escape the prison and kill the marshal responsible for the coup.

Easy read, fun story.
Finished in a single morning.

(I don't remember when or how I got this -- it's been on the shelf in my bedroom for years, possibly over a decade.)
