This was recommended by both Fiona and kaberett, and given to me by Mum for my 27th birthday.
It's by the same author as the [*The Night Circus*](/book-reviews/the-night-circus/), which I very much enjoyed.

I very much enjoyed this. It intersperses a variety of stories and books, with different strands that gradually draw together. It's a bit meta, in a way -- the magic of this place is about stories and myths and narratives, and it's exactly the sort of surrealist magic I really enjoy.

I don't fully understand all the different strands, and I probably missed some detail on the first readthrough (at nearly 500 pages, it's not exactly "light") -- but I got the gist of it.
I'll definitely be re-reading to understand it more fully soon.
