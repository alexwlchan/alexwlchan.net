This is a very character-driven book. It switches between the seven characters, with each chapter told from a different person’s perspective. Everyone has a strong arc, a lesson they learn during the book. I found all of the main characters compelling, and I wanted to learn more – and it didn’t feel like it was too crowded. Although it jumps around, I never found myself lost or unsure of what was happening.

The characters come at the expense of the plot. We see more of their inner monologues, their thoughts and feelings, than actual events – and the teacher/student romance that’s set up as the central plot line gets scant time on the page. I enjoyed the characters enough not to mind, but it may not be everyone’s cup of tea. It’s very “high school”.

I enjoyed reading it, it was a nice way to welcome in 2018, but I won’t be rushing to re-read it.

I picked this up [on Sass's advice](https://twitter.com/supergirl_sass/status/803333728030179328).
