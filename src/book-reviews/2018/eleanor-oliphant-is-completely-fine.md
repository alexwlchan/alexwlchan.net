I wanted to like this book, but it didn’t grab me. :-/

I’ve tried to read it twice, but I stalled both times, and realised I wasn’t really feeling anything about what I’d read so far. No enjoyment or annoyance, just a faint sense of “meh”. I got about 80 pages in on my second read, but I’m not bonding with the main character at all.

Reviews assure me that it’s a great book and that it really picks up towards the end; I just have a large enough TBR pile that I don’t feel like slogging on to see if I enjoy the ending more.
