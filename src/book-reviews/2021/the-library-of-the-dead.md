A fun fantasy book set in a dystopian Edinburgh.
The protagonist – Ropa – can talk to the dead, carry messages for them, and gets enlisted to help find a missing child.
She discovers children are having their life forced sucked from them, and has to rescue them as best she can.

The world has a sort-of scientific form of magic (plus a secret library to study it), but also feels very grounded in the geography of Edinburgh.

I enjoyed the book, but I didn't love it.
