Short and sweet book about being a manager.
It covers a bunch of topics, including the different phases of building a team, how to help team mates grow, setting expectations and communicating well.
Lots of useful advice, usually accompanied by stories to help the message stick.

I confess, I found the topic a little dry, and I drifted off at times.
I'll need to listen to it again to take proper notes.
