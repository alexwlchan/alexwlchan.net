I've had this book on my TBR list for a very long time.
I was at a showing of the 2001 film in Cirencester many years ago, and I don't remember any of the plot, but I remember wanting to find out more.

According to my notes, I've tried to read it at least one before -- with an abortive attempt in April 2018.
This time around, I was more successful.

The book revolves around a doctor (Iannis) and his daughter (Palagia) on the Greek island of Cephallonia.
We see how their lives are affected by young love, the German/Italian occupation during WWII, the earthquake in 1953, and more.

It took me a few chapters to get into it, but by the end I was really invested in the characters.
It's a story about love and grief and heartbreak, and I was very moved by the ending.

I don't know if I would've picked up this book without the film, but I'm glad I did, and I'm glad I'm finally finished it.
