Hannah gave this to me for my birthday in 2012, after we watched [The Lizzie Bennet Diaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lizzie_Bennet_Diaries) together.
It's been on my shelf ever since, and I've never quite got round to reading it.

I'm trying to clear out my pile of old unread books, and decided to pick this one up for February.
It's a good book, and I can see why it's popular, but I don't think it's for me.
Although the chapters are short, I was quite slow to get through it, and I never felt compelled to continue reading.

I've read part one and a bit of part two, and now I'm putting it back on my shelf.
I'm glad I have the book and I'm glad I've read some of it, but I'm not going to finish it any time soon.
