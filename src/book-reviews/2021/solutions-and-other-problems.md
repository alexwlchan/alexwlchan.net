This was a gift from Coco for Christmas 2020.

It's not exactly a fun book – it has Allie Brosh's inimitable humour and charm, but it touches on some hard topics.
Mental health, loneliness, and death all feature in this book, and the dedication rings differently after chapter 10.
Particularly after a year of a global pandemic, it's not a light book.
But it's good, and I enjoyed it, and I'll never be sad to have more of her writing.
