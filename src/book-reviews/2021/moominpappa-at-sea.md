I continue my quest to read the Moomin books in completely the wrong order.

Another fun if slightly haunting tale – the Moomins leave Moominvalley for an island in the middle of the sea, and they have various adventures exploring the island and learning about the new place they've come to.
It's a charming book that leaves plenty of questions unanswered – sometimes things just are, and that's okay.

There's also a gorgeous watercolour illustration on the back that I used to wish the Moomin queen [a happy birthday](https://twitter.com/alexwlchan/status/1428968625457831941/photo/1).
