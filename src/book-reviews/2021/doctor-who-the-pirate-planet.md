A Doctor Who book written by Douglas Adams should be my cup of tea, but it completely failed to land with me.
Two hours in, and I didn't feel connected to any of the characters or any desire to keep reading.
(I had three hours of solo driving when I could have kept listening, and completely forgot I'd borrowed this book from the library.)
