I think the RNLI do amazing work, so it's no surprise I liked this book.
Each of the eleven chapters tell a story of a notable rescue: ten from the perspective of RNLI crew, the eleventh from the person rescued.
All well-told, gripping rescues that I finished quickly.
I enjoyed the extra detail of the blow-by-blow accounts.
More like this please!

This was a gift from Auntie May Shui for my birthday.
