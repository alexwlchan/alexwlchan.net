I enjoyed this both for the gender shenanigans, and for reading an older version of some of the fairy tales I'm used to.

The text differences are much lighter touch than I was expecting -- it's apparently a sophisticated find and replace, but with no more editorialising than that.
Any imbalances are lifted directly from the original text.

The hardback version has gorgeous illustrations, and feels like a proper book of fairy tales.
It's a book with presence and heft.

I first heard of this book in a [tweet from @Foyles](https://twitter.com/Foyles/status/1324403856353026048), linking to a blog post [The origins of Gender Swapped Fairy Tales](https://www.foyles.co.uk/Public/Biblio/Detail.aspx?blogId=2055)
