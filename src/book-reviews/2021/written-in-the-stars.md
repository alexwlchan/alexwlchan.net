I got this from the library on a whim, and I adored it; I've bought a paper copy for my bookshelf.

It's a queer rom-com between Elle (a self-confident astrologist looking for love) and Darcy (a guarded actuary who's sworn off dating).
After a disastrous blind date, they start fake dating, and they quickly realise neither of them have fake feelings.
Brief interlude where they break up because Darcy doesn't know how to talk about her feelings, but it's a happy ending.

I nearly bounced off it from second-hand embarrassment on the blind date, but once I got into it I got invested very quickly.
I love all the characters and just want them to be happy.
Darcy and Elle are a great blend of whimsy and seriousness.

The narration is excellent, the plot moves at a good pace, the characters are fun.
Some parts don't translate as well to an audiobook (in particular, the X-based-on-your-sign lists and text message conversations), but it was manageable.

This is apparently the first book in a trilogy, so I'll definitely be reading the rest.
Lots of fun.
