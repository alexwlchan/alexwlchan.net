I got a signed copy of this book at the launch event, a delightful evening full of queer people.

Queer Christian poetry isn't really my thing, and I won't pretend I'd have bought this if Jay wasn't a close friend.
I like the ideas in some of the poems, but there weren't many that jumped out at me.
(Especially as I'd already heard quite a few of them at the launch event.)
