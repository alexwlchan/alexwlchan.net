A fun collection of little mysteries from the town of Stain'd-by-the-Sea.
It works as a standalone book (it's been years since I read *All the Wrong Questions*), and adds a bit of detail and colour to the town's residents.

I borrowed it from the library, which was the right choice -- I enjoyed it, but I think I'm unlikely to read it again.
