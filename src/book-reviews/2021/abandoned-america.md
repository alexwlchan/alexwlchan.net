This is one of several photo books by the same author, which I saw [from their Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/abandonedameric/).

I thought this would be a nice coffee table book with pretty photographs of derelict ruins; the accompanying essays elevate it beyond that.
It gives the history of the places, why they were significant, and often how they were demolished.
The essays frame the destruction as a tragedy; the loss of something irreplaceable.
That we won't see this sort of architecture or design again.
