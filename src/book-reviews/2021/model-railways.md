Am I ever going to build a model railway?
It seems somewhat unlikely – but this was a fun read nonetheless.
Good info and some gorgeous pictures.

It's also dated in a rather charming way – mail-order catalogues and packages are described as somewhat of a novelty, and the Internet isn't mentioned at all.
It doesn't detract from the book at all; was just something I noticed as I was reading.

(I don't remember how I got this; it's been on my shelves for a long time.
There's a price scrawled in the cover so I guess I got it second-hand, but I have no idea where.)
