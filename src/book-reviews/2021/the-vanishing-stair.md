The sequel to [*Truly Devious*](/book-reviews/truly-devious/).
Very similar vibes to the first book – I enjoyed it, good narration, I was intrigued by the plot and I got through it quickly.

The overall story advances quite a bit – we get answers to several threads left from the first book, and a few new threads are dangled.
It ends a bit abruptly and I'm glad I can get the next book at the library, or I'd be a bit annoyed.
