Some interesting ideas about design, but fairly wordy, and nothing new to me.

I’ve often heard this book held up as a paragon of good design advice, which is why I wanted to read it. There are definitely nuggets of wisdom, but it’s very verbose. I think you could condense the examples and explanations, it’d be shorter and punchier. I skimmed a lot of the book, because if I’d read every word I’d never have finished.

There wasn’t much new to me—I’ve heard most of these ideas before, which probably reflects some of the idealism in my social circle.

I probably won’t read it again, and I’d only recommend it if you’re willing to skim heavily.
