Christmas gift from Ed.

A series of questions answered in the most ludicrous, outlandish way possible. Typical levels of XKCD over-doing it and answering a problem in a ridiculous way. (How do we modify a piano to cover the full range of human/animal hearing, for example?)

Good for dipping into, and the longer chapters felt more satisfying than previous Randall Munroe books.
