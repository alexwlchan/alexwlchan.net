Good mixture of the mathematical bits and history of the relevant people. Covers a lot of ideas in a fairly compact way.

I don’t know how accessible the mathematical explanations are (I skipped them; I’ve already come across most of it), but the historical details all worked. And the cast in each chapter is usefully small – there’s not much skipped around “oh, this name was last mentioned three chapters ago, who was that again”? So that was nice.

Glad to have read, now going on the charity shop pile for the next person.
