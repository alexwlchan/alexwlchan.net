Quote, when describing the Apollo 13 mission:

> Could the [Lunar Module] be pressed into this unfamiliar role?
> Yes, it not only was theoretically possible but it had been considered before and documented in detail.
> The appropriate volume was snatched from the shelf, and Mission Control and the crew were soon working on the life-saving procedures which allowed them to limp home.
> Needless to say, the oxygen supply system was redesigned before the next flight.
> That the vast majority of the emergency library has remained untouched over the years is no indictment of it.
> It was one of NASA's wisest investments.
