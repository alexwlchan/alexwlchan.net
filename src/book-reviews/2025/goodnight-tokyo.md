A collection of short stories set in Tokyo's twilight hours -- a taxi driver who runs a late service, a woman who works in a call centre, or women who run a diner for patrons in the dead of night.

I enjoyed this, but not as much as I have other books in the genre -- I think a combination of a few too many stories in one novel, not enough time for each of them to breathe, and not as much emotional resonance or weight behind any one story.
