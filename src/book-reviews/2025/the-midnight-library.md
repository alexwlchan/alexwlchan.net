A fun take on the "what if" genre -- after committing suicide, Nora is invited to try lives where she made different decisions.
What if she became a pop singer?
Or a glaciologist?
Or an Olympic swimmer?
What if she dated that man, or married another?

I worked out the conclusion fairly quickly, because I've done a lot of that sort of "what if" thinking for my own life. 
A different set of decisions might make you happier, but there's no way to know whether it would be a definite improvement, or what things might change in that other timeline.

I enjoyed the journey to the conclusion, although I did get second-hand embarrassment from Nora's inexperience and lack of knowledge in some of her alternative lives.
