Twenty-four hours in the life of six astronauts and cosmonauts on a space station; more than a dozen orbits around the earth.
We see their emotions, their hopes and dreams, how they feel about space and space exploration.

I went in with a completely misguided idea of what this book was going to be -- I thought it was a memoir of a female astronaut on ISS, and I was quite looking forward to that.
It wasn't until it there's a moon landing on the same day that I realised this is actually a fiction novel.

Overall I enjoyed it, once I realised what sort of book it was.
It's a very lyrical, colourful prose – it reminds me of [*This Is How You Lose the Time War*](/book-reviews/this-is-how-you-lose-the-time-war/) -- more about the emotions of their astronauts, less their actions.
It's a beautiful reflection on what it means to be an explorer of space, the impact humans leave on the world as we move through it, and the ultimate impact of those trips into space.

I didn't love it quite as much as some people, but I went in with high expectations that would be difficult to meet.
