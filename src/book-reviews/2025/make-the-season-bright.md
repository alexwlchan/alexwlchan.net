A cute little romance set at Christmas.
Charlotte and Brighton are musicians who were engaged until it all fell apart on their wedding day; they haven't talked to each other until they end up at the same Christmas event.

It's cute and romantic and hits some classic tropes (including drunken confessions and snowed in).
Both of them desperately need therapy rather than restarting their relationship, but it works as a romance novel and I enjoyed it.
