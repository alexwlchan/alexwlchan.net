This book is about persuading us of the potential of railways, and how to unlock it -- how trains can solve the climate crisis in a way that planes and cars are unable to.

It presents an optimistic "here's what could happen", rather than a realistic projection of what's likely to happen -- it's more how railways *could* fix the future, than how they will.

I found it a compelling and detailed discussion, with the right amount of evidence and examples to back up the key points.
It's broken down into small, digestible pieces that I found easy to read.
In particular, I was able to read it over multiple sessions, rather than trying to digest the whole thing in one go.

I like trains so I'm a biased reader, but I enjoyed this book.
