Charles is a robot butler who needs to find a job, and takes a journey through an apocalyptic wasteland to find it.
It's a dark and absurd journey, and I very much enjoyed it.

The writing style reminds me of Douglas Adams, in a good way -- it's describing the aftermath of a robot apocalypse, but in a lyrical and humourous style.
The world isn't tragic, but absurd.

It has some points to make about automation, class divisions, and our attitude towards work, but it feels quite measured -- it has a point to make, but I didn't feel it was overwhelming.
I could enjoy the story without thinking too hard about robot politics.

It was slow in a few parts, especially the latter half, but it still held my attention and I finished it quickly.
