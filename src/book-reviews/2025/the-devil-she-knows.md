A hot and steamy romance from one of my favourite authors.
Sam is heartbroken when her girlfriend Helen rejects her proposal and breaks up with her; distraught, she accepts a deal with Daphne to get six wishes in exchange for her soul.

The plan is to use the wishes to win Helen back, but it doesn't go to plan -- she realises Helen isn't actually right for her, and falls in love with Daphne instead.
And of course, Daphne takes some creative license when interpreting Sam's wishes.

I had fun reading this, and got swept along with their romance.
