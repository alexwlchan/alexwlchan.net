A fun friends-to-lovers romance -- El has a crush on her best friend Jay, but isn't sure if Jay reciprocates her feelings, and is stewing in the misery of unrequited love.

I enjoyed this -- El's experience of a crush felt very relatable, and there's a lot of charming and cosy stuff to go with it as they move to a queer commune in the countryside together.
(And I especially relate to their short-lived enjoyment of a London commute!)

This the second sapphic romance I've read by Laura Kay, and I've enjoyed both of them.
She hasn't blown me away, but they're solid romance novels and I'll look for more of her work.
