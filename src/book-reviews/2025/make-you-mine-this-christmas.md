A charming fake dating romcom set in a fancy house in the Cotswolds after a meet-cute in a bookshop at a London station; it's like this was written for me.
A fun and easy romance, and aside from a bit of second-hand embarrassment when Haf is first meeting Christopher and Kit's family, I really enjoyed this.
