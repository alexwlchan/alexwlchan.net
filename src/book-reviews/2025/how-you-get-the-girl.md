A charming sapphic romance.
It's been too long since I read one of these, and I really enjoyed it.

When I started reading, I was a little bit worried.
Elle is a famous basketball player who Julie idolised as a teenager, and that has the potential for some unhealthy power dynamics.
Fortunately, I think the book swerves to avoid it.

It actually sets up a really nice parallel arc for the two characters.
Elle is proud and confident about being queer, but she struggles to be a a foster parent to her niece, Vanessa.
Julie is a capable high school coach who bonds well with her team, but feels unsure and uncertain about her queer identity.
They both look up to the other in one regard, and in another regard are looked up to.

It hits all the classic sapphic tropes and has a feel-good ending.
This is the third part of a three-part trilogy, and I'm going to go back and read the other two books.
