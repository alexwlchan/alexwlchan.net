A charming queer romance set against the backdrop of a cooking show.
It's the prequel to [*How You Get the Girl*](/book-reviews/how-you-get-the-girl/), which I read in June.

I enjoyed having a non-binary character (London) as one half of the main couple, and their anxiety over being accepted by a cis woman (Dahlia).
It follows a classic romance arc and I enjoyed reading it.
Fun, but nothing standout.
