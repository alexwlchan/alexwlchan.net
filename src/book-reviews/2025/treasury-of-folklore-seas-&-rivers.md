Stories of sea creatures and river dwellers from folklore; this book covers a variety of folklore from a wide variety of places (not just the usual Western folklore).

I enjoyed this more than I expected, because many books like this get bogged down in detail -- not here.
It doesn't dwell on any one story for too long, just a short explanation, comparison to similar stories, then onward to the next.
This book would be a good way to decide what stories to read further -- it's not a detailed reference itself, but a broad summary.

Words aside, the hardback is a gorgeous physical object.
It has fine lines of shiny gold which really sell the water texture.
