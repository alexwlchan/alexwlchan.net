The revised version of *Antimemetics Division*, which I originally read [in March 2022](/book-reviews/there-is-no-antimemetics-division/).

I raced through this because the plot is broadly the same, but the prose has been tightened in a number of places -- I particularly enjoyed the extended explanation of humanity when Marie Quinn (formerly Marion Wheeler) sees all of ideatic space.

It's still great and I'd recommend this version to anybody encountering antimemetics for the first time; the slight dissonance I had with the renamed characters won't affect a new reader.
