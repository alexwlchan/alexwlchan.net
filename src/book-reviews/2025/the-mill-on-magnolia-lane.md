A cute little romance novel about Lizzie, who buys an abandoned mill after her father dies, and vows to renovate it.
Things go fairly wrong for the women in her family -- a gas explosion, a cheating partner, an unexpected pregnancy -- and she gradually gathers them in the caravan where she's overseeing the building works.

The romance is with Jude, a local architect with a slightly complicated backstory -- he's still close with his ex, Harriet, with whom he has a young son Artie.
Lizzie feels threatened by Harriet's presence, despite Jude's insistence that they're no longer romantically involved.

It's a pleasant if unremarkable novel that I enjoyed reading, but won't return to.
