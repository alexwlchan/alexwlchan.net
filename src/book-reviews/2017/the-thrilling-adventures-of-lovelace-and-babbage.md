Really enjoyed it. The book is part-comic, part-footnote, with the footnote commentary providing snippets of a biography for Babbage and Lovelace.

I found the comic sections very funny, and now I have all sorts of fluffy feelings for Babbage and Lovelace in the Pocket Universe. But where it really shines is in the history – it’s clear the author has spent a lot of time researching the pair. Lots of new and interesting facts, and a comic turns out to be a great way to convey aspects of their character.

My one quibble is that I struggled to find the flow. Read the comic, then re-read for the footnotes? Footnotes as I go along? A mix of both? That slowed me down a bit.

Meta: this book has sat on a shelf for a while, in part because it was a gift from somebody who shortly after fell out of my life. Worth the wait, and has also provided an excellent connection with Chris H at work.
