Two girls from Melbourne go travelling in Europe, end up crossing paths in Berlin, and continue their travels together. One bi, one ace-are. The story itself is really charming, and doesn’t fall into the usual trap of an unexpected romance – just two people who become good friends.

I was recommended this book for having good ace rep, and it really does – more so than I expected. It’s tastefully done, and it made me so happy reading it. Ace-aro characters are all too rare in fiction, so this one feels extra special.
