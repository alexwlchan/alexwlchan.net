Book was interesting, and I enjoyed reading it. It’s unfortunately still rare to read about notable historical women – and indeed, the text notes that Granuaile was largely erased within the annals of the Gaelic historical records. She’s a fascinating character – not just a pirate, but a strategist, politician and naval officer (of sorts).

Like many history books, I found it a little hard to follow the jumble of names, and I sometimes had to re-read bits to be sure I knew what was going on. It might benefit from an edit, and including a few more diagrams and maps. I knocked off a star for that.
