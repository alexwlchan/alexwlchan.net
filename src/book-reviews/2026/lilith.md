In this story, the mother god Asherah is quickly subdued by Yahweh, a patriarchal god who wants to subjugate women, acts as the only god, and teaches Adam to be ambitious and dominant. The story weaves across millennia as Lilith tries to rescue Asherah and her lessons of motherhood and caring.

I enjoyed this, and I learned a lot about characters I’d never come across – not just Lilith, but also Jezebel, Samael, and the gnostic gospels. The book has a fictionalised version of them, but includes afternotes that explain the more “factual” versions.

I did find some of the prose overly descriptive and colourful at points, but that’s not uncommon for this sort of story. It reminded me of Greek translations in school.

I bought this because the author was doing a signing event with a friend, and it’s not something I think I’d have read otherwise. I’m glad I did.

## Favourite quotes

P92:

> Samael took a running leap and soared into the air. He dived onto Senoy, sending him spinning into the chasm. He soared upwards to knock Sansenoy, limbs flailing, into the sky. Adam sat, parked firmly on the boards. I dropped the leash and ran for solid ground.
>
> Locked in airborne struggle, Sansenoy and Samael tumbled as one into the void. Senoy was nowhere to be seen. Adam, senseless to the commotion around him, perched rigid on the bridge.
> 
> ‘Come!’ I beckoned. But he would not move.
> 
> Semangelof saw I wanted the mule. He understood why I needed him. He rose and dived into the bridge like a falcon at his prey. With a great splintering crack, he broke through the boards. The ropes snapped. Severed, the bridge fell to each side of the chasm.
> 
> Adam fell through the rushing air. He accepted his fate as he bore all life’s events, issuing but a mild whinny of amazement as he dropped into the void. He was gone. With all the gifts and offerings we’d brought: the crown of pure gold, the pearl-woven robes, the coral bracelets, the carnelian necklace, the lapis-inlaid dagger, the brooch pins and clasps – even the saffron-scented cakes. All we needed to bribe our way into the Underworld and flatter its queen.
