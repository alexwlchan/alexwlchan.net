An interesting book about the use of colour in film, how different technology for filming in colour was developed, and examples of specific films that made good use of colour.
I don't watch a lot of films, so a lot of the names were new to me and the author's points probably didn't land as strongly as if I'd actually seen them – but I got enough to keep reading.

Lots of good pictures and solid colour palettes, so I could still keep up.
