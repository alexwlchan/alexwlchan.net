This is based on the Apple TV+ show "Silo", and I read it after loving the first season.
It covers a lot more events than the show, and overall I enjoyed it.

I read it in slightly fragmented chunks, and maybe my enjoyment was marred by sickness that was coming on at the time – but it's the first part of a trilogy, and I was hooked enough to want to read the next two books.
