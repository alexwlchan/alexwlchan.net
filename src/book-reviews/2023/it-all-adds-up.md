Another "pop sci" book about the history of mathematics.
There were a few bits that were quite interesting to me, especially the stories about very early civilisations (i.e. before the Greeks, which is where a lot of these histories start), but it dragged a bit in the later chapters and I felt I was reading less stuff that was new to me.
