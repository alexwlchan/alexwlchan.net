A powerful, gripping book about Kayleigh, a content moderator for an unnamed social media site.
It explores the psychological impact of the review process on her and her coworkers.

The subject makes it a heavy read, but I couldn't stop reading – it was a compelling, if somewhat heartbreaking, story.
