A gorgeous little story about a boy who lives in a book shop, and becomes withdrawn and isolated after the death of his grandfather.
By taking him into three labyrinths to "rescue" books, the nameless tabby cat helps him realise the power of books – and the importance of looking beyond them.

Ostensibly it's about the value of books, but really it's about the value of empathy and compassion for other people.

Sweet, short, fun.
