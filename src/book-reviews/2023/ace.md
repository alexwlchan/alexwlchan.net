A non-fiction book discussing a bunch of aspects of asexuality.
I read the first part of this for book club, then sort of fizzled out in the later parts.

I'm not sure why it struggled to hold my attention – maybe the lack of a strong narrative?
There's lots of good information in here, but there was no hook to keep me reading.

I know other aces have really resonated with this book, but it didn't do much for me.
