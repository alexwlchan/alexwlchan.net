A fun, interesting overview of this segment of the LEGO building world.
Plenty of clear explanations and pretty pictures, which explain everything from first principles rather than assuming lots of prior knowledge.
I'm not sure I'm about to jump into this hobby, but I'm still glad to have read it and to get a slightly deeper understanding of what's involved.
