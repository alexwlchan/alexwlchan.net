<!--series: "The Railway Detective #18" -->

This is the second book I've read in the Railway Detective series, after [*Tragedy on the Branch Line*](/book-reviews/tragedy-on-the-branch-line/).
It was pleasant if unremarkable, and I could see several of the same character tropes and archetypes from the first book I read.
It worked as a light read, but it doesn't leave me rushing to read the rest of the series.
