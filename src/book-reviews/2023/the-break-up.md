A nice rom-com about a woman in a strained engagement (Edi and Rowan), who emerges from her shell when her fiancé suggests a break.
With the encouragement of her girl friends, she realises how much of herself she's been cutting off to fit into the relationship, and finds a new love in Winifred (aka Fred).

It's fine; I like that all the relationships between the women are supportive and not antagonistic, and they're all looking out for each other.
Even Rowan isn't a one-dimensional villain -- he made some mistakes, but we see enough of his parents to understand why he behaves as he does.

Nothing amazing but a fun read on the commute.
