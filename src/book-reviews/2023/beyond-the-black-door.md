A fantasy story in a world with high religion and the ability to enter other people's souls when they're sleeping.
The protagonist is a soul walker, but she doesn't have her own soul or space to wander in – instead, when she wanders in other people's souls, she sees a locked black door that her mother has forbidden to open.

I thought it was fine.
The worldbuilding and concept are fun if slightly under-explored, and the characters are a little one-dimensional.
The protagonist is ace and it feels like a big part of the story, which I enjoyed.
