A compact collection of useful information about working with SVG.

I learnt about a bunch of features I hadn't encountered before – particular highlights were animations with SMIL, and clips/masking with transparent or photographic masks.
The writing was clear and concise, the illustrations were useful, and it's given me some ideas for new projects with SVG.
