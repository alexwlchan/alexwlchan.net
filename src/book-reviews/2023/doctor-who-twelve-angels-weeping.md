A good anthology of short stories, each exploring a different *Doctor Who* villain.
Some of them lean into the villain more than others, and I enjoyed the stories that explored a particular aspect in a way I hadn't seen before.

I most enjoyed the Cybermen (*Ghost in the Machine*), the Daleks (*The Third Wise Man*) and the Master (*Anything You Can Do*).
Although all three of those are practically clichés, it was a fresh take on each of them.

The illustrations are great; I want them on my wall.
