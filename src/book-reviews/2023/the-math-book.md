A bit of a coffee-table book, it's a large tome runs through a bunch of ideas in roughly chronological order.
Each idea is a double-page spread: the left-hand page has a couple of paragraphs explaining it, the right-hand page has a picture which is loosely associated.

It had some interesting ideas, but the format meant it couldn't go into much depth.
I picked up a few new things to remember, but most of it was familiar.

Some of the pictures were better than others; in quite a few places it went for a more visually appealing image over something that would explain the concept.
Didn't hate it, didn't love it.
Probably going on the charity shop pile.
