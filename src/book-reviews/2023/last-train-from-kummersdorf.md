A story about two children, Hanno and Effi, who are fleeing war-torn Germany, and neither trusts the other.
It touches upon the horrific aspects of war -- including the death of Hanno's twin brother Wolfgang, and the rape of one of their travelling companions -- without being needlessly graphic.

The antagonists are well done -- Major Otto is a cartoon villain, but perhaps the bigger monster is the soft-spoken doctor who's revealed to be a Nazi doctor and child eugenicist.
It's a reminder that evil can wear a respectable face.

I enjoyed it, insofar as you can enjoy a book about horrific events, but it struggled to hold my attention at times.
