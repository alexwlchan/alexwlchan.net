A gorgeous romance/mystery about Will, a man whose partner Elsa vanished in the midst of a World War II bombing, and who nobody else remembers.

The story cuts between the past -- Will's written memories of Elsa -- and the present -- where Laura, a care worker, is trying to work out if Elsa is real or made-up.
There are clues scattered throughout, and I was quite pleased by the ending, which pulls together all the strands in a neat way.
At moments it leans a little hard on coincidences (including Laura and Will meeting), but I didn't mind because I was so wrapped up in the characters.

Clever, heartwarming, sweet.
