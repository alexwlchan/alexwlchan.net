I wanted to be more engaged with this than I was; it's about the idea of getting lost in various forms (more than just not knowing where you are).
There are passages about the human condition that really struck a chord, and other pieces where I was a bit bored.

Some interesting ideas here, but I'd recommend skimming rather than reading cover to cover.
