title: An AWS costs graph that works for me
summary: How I get a Cost Explorer graph for the last 30 days of spending, broken down by service.

If you use AWS, it's always a good idea to keep an eye on your costs.
It's easy to start spending lots of money inadvertently, or waste money because of some inefficient configuration, and then you get a nasty surprise when your bill arrives.
I like to have a quick glance at our bill every month or so, just to check for unexpected spikes or changes.

Amazon have a service called [Cost Explorer] with lots of graphing and reporting tools to slice your bill in different ways.
I have a Python script that opens a graph that I find useful:

[Cost Explorer]: https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- encoding: utf-8

import datetime as dt
from urllib.parse import urlencode, urlparse, urlunparse
import webbrowser


today = dt.datetime.now()

query_dict = {
    # Look at costs for the last thirty days
    "startDate": (today - dt.timedelta(days=30)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),
    "endDate": today.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),
    "timeRangeOption": "Custom",

    # Break down costs by day
    "granularity": "Daily",

    # Line chart of API operation costs
    "chartStyle": "Line",
    "filter": '[{"dimension":"Operation","values":[""],"include":false,"children":null}]',
    "groupBy": "Operation",

    # Give it a nice title
    "isTemplate": "true",
    "reportName": "Daily API operation costs",
    "reportType": "CostUsage",
}

parts = [
    # scheme
    "https",

    # netloc
    "console.aws.amazon.com",

    # path
    "/cost-reports/home",

    # params
    "",

    # query
    "",

    # fragment
    "/custom?%s" % urlencode(query_dict)
]

webbrowser.open(urlunparse(parts))
```

All of the Cost Explorer settings can be configured as URL query parameters.
This script sets those query parameters, creates a URL and then asks my web browser to open the page.
Assuming I'm logged in to AWS, I see a graph like this:

<figure>

    I don't know if I can share the exact numbers outside Wellcome, but the shape of our bill isn't a big secret.
    We've just migrated a lot of our digital archive up to S3, so it's not a surprise that our biggest cost is S3.

This is a line graph of our most expensive API operations over the last 30 days.

The line graph makes it easy to pick out trends (as opposed to the alternative, a stacked bar chart).
For example, I can see there was a big spike in GetObject calls in middle of October.
If I wasn't expecting that, it's a cue to do some digging, and find out why that cost was higher than usual.

About a year or so ago, checked this graph saved us a lot of money.
We'd set up some new VPCs with a NAT Gateway, and all our AWS traffic was going through the NAT Gateway, via the public internet.
You pay per gigabyte of data transferred through a NAT Gateway -- so it pretty expensive!
Because we spotted the sudden spike upwards, and we knew what change we'd just made, finding the cause wasn't hard.
We realised we had to set up [VPC endpoints](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/vpc-reduce-nat-gateway-transfer-costs/), which are much cheaper.

You can fill lots of spreadsheets and scripts with numbers from your AWS bill, and analyse it in dozens of ways -- but a picture speaks a thousand words, and for a quick glance, that's more than enough.
