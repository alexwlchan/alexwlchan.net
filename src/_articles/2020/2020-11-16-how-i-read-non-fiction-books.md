I've spent a lot of this year reading books.
That was the plan, even before the pandemic -- I have a large pile of unread books -- and then I just got more time to read than I expected.

We all have an idea of what "reading a book" means, but it means different things to different people.
Everyone has their our own styles and approaches to reading, and there's no one right way to read a book.
I've developed a bit of a process around how I read -- particularly around non-fiction books -- and in this post I'm going to explain that process.

But before we ask how to read a book, we need to ask: why do we read books?
There are lots of reasons you might read a book, and they'll affect what you want to get out of a book, and how to approach it.
My process works for me, and lets me get what I want out of books -- but it may not work for you, if you read for different reasons.

Most of my non-fiction reading is for pleasure.
I don't need to remember everything in detail, and I have no immediate use for the information.
But I do want to remember the key ideas, and I want to be able to find a book again later, if there's an idea I want to revisit.

When I'm reading, I keep a notebook and a pen to hand.
At the end of each section or chapter, I scribble a few notes, and move on.
I'm trying to capture the major ideas, interesting stories, or passages I want to save verbatim.

    The handwriting is barely readable, but that&rsquo;s okay, because I convert the notes into a more legible format pretty quickly.

My initial notes are handwritten because handwriting is flexible -- I can write sentences, or fragments, or even sketch tiny diagrams.
It's a minimal interruption from looking at the book.
I've tried using a variety of digital devices for this step, but they've never worked as well.

Every so often, I take my pile of handwritten notes, and I type them into my computer.
I turn them into full sentences, add any extra details I thought were worth noting, and generally tidy them up.
I'll even recreate diagrams if I find them useful.

When I type up my notes, I include chapter names, page numbers, and occasionally a passage quoted word-for-word.
Combined with full text search, this gives me something to skim to remember "What did I learn from this book?", and pointers to the parts to re-read if I want to find a specific story or detail.

I never actually write in my books.
I understand why people do that, and if I was using a book as a detailed reference I might try it -- but it's overkill for what I want.
I want notes that I can read for basic recall, not a comprehensive list of everything explained in the book.
I can skim much faster if all the notes are in one place, not scattered through the book.
(I also give away a fair number of books once I finish them, so it's useful to have the notes separate from the book.)

This process slows me down, but it dramatically improves my retention rate.
Since I started doing this, I've been much better at remembering the main ideas of the books I’ve read -- and notes plus memory are a powerful combination for storing the details. ✨
