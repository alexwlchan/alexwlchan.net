  - title: "Building Trust in an Age of Suspicious Minds"
    conference: "PyCon UK 2018"
    date: "15 Sept"
    description: |+
      I was invited to give the opening keynote at [this year's PyCon UK](https://2018.pyconuk.org/).

      This is the abstract I wrote:

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          In 2018, trust is at a low.
          Over the past several decades, trust has declined &ndash; fewer and fewer people trust each other, and the reputation of big institutions (government, media, politicians, even non-profits) is in tatters.
        </p>

        <p>
          What happened?
        </p>

        <p>
          In this talk, I&ndash;ll explain how the design of certain systems have been exploited for abuse, and this has corroded our trust &ndash; and conversely, how we can build environments that encourage and sustain good behaviour.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
