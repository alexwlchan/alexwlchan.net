    event: "PyCon UK"
    date: "13 Sept"

    description: |+
      Programmers have access to plenty of powerful, flexible libraries -- and yet we often end up reinventing the wheel.
      Why?
      Because our libraries aren't reusable -- code gets trapped by its I/O model.
      If we program in a "sans I/O" pattern, we get code that's simpler, more flexible, and easier to test and reuse.

      Build automation is great, right?
      We can save time, automate releases, script tedious tasksâ€¦ but what happens when these build robots turn against us?

      When we imagine inclusive design, we think about helping people from minoritised or excluded groups.
      People who are disabled, or BAME, or LGBTQ+.
      We should consider them in our designs -- but if we design for them, are they the only ones who benefit?
      The Curb Cut Effect suggests otherwise: designing for people who are excluded or marginalised can often result in a better design for everyone.

      We build services with good intent, trying to improve interactivity and connections between our users.
      But what if one of our users has a stalker, a harasser, or an abusive ex?
      How do we design services and platforms to reduce the risk of harassment and abuse from other users?
