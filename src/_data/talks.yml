      A talk about the tech industry, and how we, as people of privilege, can
      do more to build environments that are genuinely inclusive.  You can
      watch the video [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej2EJVMkTKw),
      or read the [slides and transcript](/2017/11/pyconuk-2017-privilege-inclusion/).

  - title:  A Plumberâ€™s Guide to Git
    date: 27 Oct
    description: |+
      How does Git really work under the hood?  A workshop that uses low-level
      Git "plumbing" commands to reconstruct a Git workflow from scratch.
      Along the way, we see exactly how Git stores data.  There isn't a video,
      but you can read [my notes](/2017/11/a-plumbers-guide-to-git/).
