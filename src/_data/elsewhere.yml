  description: 'Programmers have access to plenty of powerful, flexible libraries
    -- and yet we often end up reinventing the wheel.

    Why?

    Because our libraries aren''t reusable -- code gets trapped by its I/O model.

    If we program in a "sans I/O" pattern, we get code that''s simpler, more flexible,
    and easier to test and reuse.

  description: 'When we imagine inclusive design, we think about helping people from
    minoritised or excluded groups.

    People who are disabled, or BAME, or LGBTQ+.

    We should consider them in our designs -- but if we design for them, are they
    the only ones who benefit?

    The Curb Cut Effect suggests otherwise: designing for people who are excluded
    or marginalised can often result in a better design for everyone.
