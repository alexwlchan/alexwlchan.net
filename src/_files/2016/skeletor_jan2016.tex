%% This chart tracks the progess of Steve Lutz's attempt to create
%% a recursive clip loop in the annual clip show going all the way
%% back to the Skeletor clip.
%%
%% To build this file, you'll need:
%%
%%  * XeLaTeX with the hyperref, fontspec, xcolor and tikz packages
%%    (all of which are included with most standard LaTeX distros)
%%  * The Patua One and Oxygen fonts (freely downloadable from Google)
%%
%% Then compile the file as `xelatex skeletor.tex`.
