## Hi, I'm Alex.

I'm a software developer at [the Wellcome Trust][wellcome] and an open-source Python developer.
At Wellcome, I'm helping build a new platform for searching and storing our digital collections.
It's taking Wellcome's assets -- books, archives, images, and more -- and presenting them through consistent, well-designed APIs.

I contribute to open source Python in my free time, including the [Hypothesis testing library][hypothesis] and the [hyper-h2 HTTP/2 stack][hyper].
I'm one of the organisers for the [PyCon&nbsp;UK][pycon] conference, and I've given a number of talks about Python (among other topics).
I'm also a volunteer room steward at [The National Museum of Computing][tnmoc], as I have a personal interest in historic computing and World War II espionage.

This blog focuses on programming, but that's not the only topic -- I write about anything I find interesting or worth sharing.
It also serves as a way to sharpen my skills in writing, and improve my ability to explain my ideas.
The site name is a handle I use everywhere -- my name and my initials.

I hope you enjoy the site.

He/him.
