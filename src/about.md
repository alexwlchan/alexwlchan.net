## Hi, I'm Alex.

I'm a software developer living in Cambridge.

I used to study maths and spend my free time programming &ndash; now I program for work and spend my free time doing maths.
Currently I work for [the Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.ac.uk/), building the backend and search system for the new library platform.
Previously I worked for [Metaswitch Networks](http://www.metaswitch.com/), writing software for the telecoms industry.

Outside work, I enjoy reading about World War II cryptography, learning new languages, and walks in the countryside.

My pronouns are he/him.

### About the site

This site is a place for me to write, when the mood takes me.
It tends to slant towards technical topics, because that's what I'm interested in, but there's no particular theme or posting schedule.

It's built with [Hot Chocolate][hc], a static site generator written in Python.
Previously I've used Jekyll and Pelican &ndash; but I wanted to make some fine-grained customisations, and eventually it became easier just to write my own site generator from scratch.
I host the site [with Linode][linode] (referral link).
