I love it when people tell me they enjoyed something I made!
If you've found something useful, used me as an example, or learnt something new -- please send me a note and tell me about it.
A nice message can really make my day.

The best way to send me a message is by email: **<alex@alexwlchan.net>**.
Alternatively, there's a list of my social media accounts on [my contact page](/contact/).

If you're feeling extra generous, you can [send me a coffee][kofi] on Ko-fi.
