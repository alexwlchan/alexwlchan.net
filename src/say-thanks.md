title: How to say thanks

I don't get paid for the writing on this site, and I don't have advertising or sponsorship.
I earn a generous salary from my day job, which means I can spend my free time on writing, conference speaking and fun projects.

I love it when people reach out to tell me they enjoyed something I made.

If you've found something useful, used me as an example, or learnt something new -- please [send me an email][email] or [a tweet][twitter] to tell me what you read, and how it was helpful.
