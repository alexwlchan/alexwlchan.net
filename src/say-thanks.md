I love it when people tell me they enjoyed something I made.

If you've found something useful, used me as an example, or learnt something new -- please [send me an email][email] or [a tweet][twitter] to tell me what you read, and how it was helpful.

I also have a [Ko-fi page][kofi] where you can leave a tip, if you're so inclined.
