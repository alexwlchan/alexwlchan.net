title: How to say thanks
---

I love it when people tell me they enjoyed something I made.

If you've found something useful, used me as an example, or learnt something new -- please [send me an email][email] or [a tweet][twitter] to tell me what you read, and how it was helpful.

If you're inclined to make a monetary contribution, please consider donating what you would have sent me to a local food bank or homeless shelter.
I'm fortunate enough to be financially secure, and they could use the money more than me.
