title: An introduction to property-based testing and Hypothesis
---

This is a presentation I gave at [PyCon&nbsp;UK&nbsp;2016](http://2016.pyconuk.org).
This is a refined version of a talk I gave [at CamPUG](/2016/06/hypothesis-intro/) in June.

I was planning to upload some notes from this talk, but unfortunately I seem to have lost them.
Sorry about that.
