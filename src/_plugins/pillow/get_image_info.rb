  # How this works:
  #
  #   - When we have an empty cache, we get the info for every image
  #     we can find in `_src/images` and warm the cache.
  #
  #   - If the image isn't in the cache (e.g. it was just added) or the
  #     cache entry is invalid (the image has changed), we get the info
  #     for just that image.
  #
  # We want to minimise the calls to Python, because each one involves
  # a minor performance penalty we'd rather avoid.
  #
  # Jekyll will clear the cache every time `_config.yml` changes, or you
  # change your options (e.g. adding the `--profile` flag), so we warm
  # the cache to speed up that initial build.
