I've been using computers for about two decades.
I still have some of my oldest files; the earliest I can definitively date are from 2003, but I'm sure they aren't the first things I made on a computer.
(Whether I'm very old or very young depends on your perspective.)

I've created a lot of stuff in that time, and I'd like to remember it.

In theory, this is easy: I still have the files.
These days, when I finish a project, I move everything to a cold storage folder on an external hard drive.
That drive is neatly organised and backed up -- so I can usually find things when I want to.

In practice, it's a bit harder.
Having files is one thing; being able to use them is quite another.

For example, those oldest documents were made in Microsoft Word on an iMac G3 running Mac OS 9.
I can open them in a modern word processor, and they look similar -- but it's not the same.
Some of the fonts and graphics are missing, and I don't know where I'd find replacements.

Working in software makes this even harder.
I might have the code, but I can't do anything useful with it.
Getting a well-documented, actively maintained, modern software project up and running is tricky enough.
It's even trickier for a poorly-documented side project I abandoned years ago.

Files exist in a context: they rely on particular hardware and software to be readable.
The more time passes, the harder a context is to replicate.
It is possible to emulate older systems, but it's more effort than I'm going to spend for the sake of some memories.

**Screenshots are how I remember my old projects.**
I have dozens and dozens of screenshots of things I've made (and a handful of screen recordings, too).
They form a gallery of fun, silly and interesting things I've done on my computer.

I often look back through the images, and smile at what my past self worked on.
Sometimes they remind me of a project I've completely forgotten.
Sometimes I reflect on how I've changed, and how past!me made different decisions to what I'd do now.
Sometimes I'll spot a cool idea and bring it into a current project.

These screenshots form a sort of "visual journal" of my work, and the best time to take them is as I'm doing the work -- when I have the required context.

Every one of these images tells a story of something I made.
They're not as good as having the original, working thing -- but they're much better than nothing.

Eventually image formats will change too, but that's on a much longer timescale.
Images are a robust, stable format that I'll be able to read for a long time.

It's rare that I regret having a screenshot, but there are plenty of things I regret not screenshotting more.
For example, I have screenshots of things I specifically made, but not of the desktop setup I look at every day.
A lot of the stuff I'm immersed in isn't recorded at all.

**If you do digital creative work, you probably make things you're proud of or that you'd like to remember. Screenshots are a great way to do that.**
