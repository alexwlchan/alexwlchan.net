I've been using computers for at least two decades.
The earliest files I still have are from sometime in 2003; whether that makes me very old or very young depends on your perspective.
(There are probably readers of this blog who are younger than those files.)

I've created a lot of stuff in that time, and I'd like to remember it.

In theory, I still have all the pieces.
When I finish a project, I move all the files to a "cold storage" folder on an external hard drive.
That drive is always plugged in, it's neatly organised, and it's backed up -- I can usually find things when I want to.

In practice, it's a little harder.
Projects exist in a context, and the more time has passed, the harder a context is to replicate.

My oldest documents were made in Microsoft Word on an iMac G3 running Mac OS 9.
I can open them in a modern word processor, and they look somewhat similar -- but it's definitely not the same.

in theory, i still have all the pieces
I have a folder called "cold storage" where I put files for projects I've finished working on

in practice, having the files isn't the same as seeing the thing
a lot of stuff needs an env to run in, and I don't have that env any more

earliest documents are Microsoft Word 2001 running on Mac OS 9 from imac g3
i could rebuild something close to that environment
would need to track down software and fonts; not the same thing

also been programming for a decade
getting a well-documented, modern program up and running is tricky enough
a barely-documented side project from five years ago, getting all deps + software in place?
next to impossible

could i do it?
yes
will i do it?
no, not worth effort

screenshots are the way out
i have dozens and dozens of screenshots of things i've made (and a handful of screen recordings)
art gallery of interesting and fun things i've done on my computer

I do look back through it sometimes and smile at what my past self would have done
past!me made very different decisions to present!me
sometimes better now, sometimes i'll be reminded of something cool I did and bring that back in a current project
all sorts of stuff i get from looking back

a sort of "visual journal" of my work
best time ot get these is as you're doing the work -- when the thing is wokring correctly

<img src="/images/2022/screenshots_thumbnails.png" style="width: 595px;">

every one of these images tells a story of something I worked on
it's not as good as trhe origina thing, but it's much better than nothing

eventually image formats will change too, but that's on a much longer timescale
images are robust, stable format you'll be able to read for a long time

very rare that i regret having a screenshot; there are plenty of things i regret not screenshotting more
(e.g. i realise I have screenshots of different projects, but not of the software or desktop i look at every day)
stuff i'm immersed in isn't recorded at all

if you do digital creative work, you probably make things you're proud of or that you'd like to remember
screenshots are a great way to do that.

PS If you do any sort of creative digital work, take plenty of screenshots.

I can skim through a folder full of PNG images and look at my old work, grimace at past mistakes, see how much I’ve improved.

It’s much harder to run old projects, start long-abandoned code, and so on.

This, but I call that new folder “fun” instead of “archive”.

I mostly keep screenshots and images, as a sort of art gallery of silly and amusing things I’ve done with my computer. I do look back through it sometimes and chuckle at the humour of my past self.
