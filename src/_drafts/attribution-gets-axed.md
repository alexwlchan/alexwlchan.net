One rabbit hole I can never resist going down is finding the original creator of a piece of art.
This should be simple, but it's often quite difficult.
The Internet is a maze of social media accounts that only exist to repost other people's art, usually with minimal or non-existent attribution.

A popular image spawns a thousand copies, each a little further from the original.
Signatures get cropped, creators' names vanish, and we're left with meaningless phrases like "no copyright intended", as if that somehow magically absolves someone of artistic theft.

Why do I do this?
I'm a bit obsessive, a bit completionist.
I've worked in cultural heritage for eight years, which has made me more aware of copyright and more curious about provenance.
Finally, I find it satisfying to know I've found the original source, that I can't dig any further.

NEED TRANSITION

This is obviously bad for artists and creatives.
Whatever benefit you might get from the "exposure" of your work going viral, you don't get any if your name has been removed first.

So many of us have become accustomed to art as an endless, anonymous stream of "content".
A beautiful image appears in our feed, we give it a quick heart, and scroll on, with no thought for the human who sweated blood and tears to create it.
That original artist feels distant, disconected.

I came across two examples recently that remind me it's not just artists who miss out -- it's also everyone who enjoys art.

I saw a photo of some traffic lights on Tumblr.
I love this misty, nighttime aesthetic, the way the bright colours of the lights cut through the fog, the totality of the surrounding darkness.
But there was no name -- somebody had just uploaded it to their Tumblr page, it was reblogged a bunch of times, and then it appeared on my dashboard.
Who took it?

I used Google Images to find the original photographer: Lucas Zimmerman.
Then I discovered it was part of [a series][1].
And there was [a sequel][2].
I found [interviews][3].
[Context][4].
[Related work][5].
I found all this cool stuff, but only because I knew Lucas's name.

The second example was a silent video of somebody making tiny chess pieces, just captioned "wow".
It was clearly an edit of another video, with fast-paced cuts to make it accommodate a short attention span -- and again with no attribution.
This was a little harder to find -- I had to search several frames in Google Images before I found [a summary on a Russian website][summary], which had a link to [a YouTube video][chess_yt] by Левша (Levsha).

This video is four times longer than the cut-up version I found, in higher resolution, and with commentary.
I don't speak Russian, but YouTube has auto-translated subtitles.
Now I know how this amazing set was made, in the words of its creator, and I have a much better understanding of the materials and techniques involved.
(I'd never even heard of Wenge wood!)

A piece of art is more than just a single image or video.
It's a process, a human story.
When art becomes detached from its context and creator, we lose something fundamental.
Creators lose the opportunity to benefit from their work, and we lose the chance to engage with it in a deeper way.
We can't learn how it was made, find the artist's other work, or discover how to make similar art for ourselves.

The Internet has done many wonderful things for art, but it's also a machine for endless copyright infringement.
It's not just about generative AI and content scraping -- those are serious, but this problem existing long before any of us had heard of ChatGPT.
It's a thousand tiny paper cuts.
How many of us have used an image from the Internet because it showed up in a search, without a second thought for its creator?
When Google Images says "images may be subject to copyright", how many of us have really thought about what that means?

Finding the original creator is hard.
The Internet is full of shadows: copies of things that went offline years ago.
But I think it's worth the effort -- both for the original artist and ourselves.
When I read a book or watch a TV show, the credits guide me to more work by artists I've come to appreciate.
I wish the Internet was more like that.

We all lose something when art becomes just another piece of disposable content.
The next time an image catches your eye, take a moment.
Who made this?
What does it mean?
And what's their story?
