I've always been enchanted by the [Apollo lunar module][LM].
Most spaceships are smooth, sleek, and streamlined -- but this gangly, metal spider is anything but.
It only ever flew above the Moon, so it wasn't constrained by pesky things like atmosphere and drag, which dictate the design of most airborne vehicles.

Because I like it so much, I decided to make a cross-stitch version of the lander, along with the [Saturn V rocket][SV] that propelled it to the Moon, and I'm rather pleased with the result:

<img src="/images/2022/saturn_v_2x.jpg" srcset="/images/2022/saturn_v_1x.jpg 1x, /images/2022/saturn_v_2x.jpg 2x, /images/2022/saturn_v_3x.jpg 3x, /images/2022/saturn_v_4x.jpg 4x" alt="A picture in a white frame. It looks a bit like a blueprint, with white thread on a blue background. On the left hand-side is a tall, sleek rocket (the Saturn V) and on the right are the various stages of the Apollo lander (lunar module, command module, and service module). In the lower right-hand corner is some technical information, including a title and a scale.">

It took a couple of weeks from start to finish, mostly done while catching up on television.

It's based on a pattern I bought [from XStitchCollective on Etsy][etsy], who have similar patterns for the Space Shuttle and Space X Falcon rockets.
I did make a few tweaks to the purchased design.
I think my letter "R" is more readable, and the scale is more accurate: a real Saturn V really is about 450&times; taller than my piece, and likewise 90&times; for the payload.

The fabric is Zweigart 14&nbsp;count Aida in Deep Royal Blue, and the thread is DMC B5200 white.
It was framed by [Landseer Picture Framing][landseer], a local shop who make some excellent frames.

The stitching itself wasn't hard, but I was posting [work-in-progress pictures on Twitter][tweet], and the photography turned out to be way harder.

My only camera is an iPhone, which "helpfully" tries to correct the white balance of photos.
When it saw the large swathes of blue fabric, it thought there was a lighting issue and aggressively adjusted the colours.
I've taken dozens of pictures, and they all have different shades of blue.
<!-- (For an even worse example, [watch this video][video] where it cycles through a bunch of colours, even though I'm sat under a white duvet in a fixed light.) -->
(The picture below has a green sheen that doesn't look quite right.)

<!-- I also had to convert the photos from a P3 colour profile to sRGB before uploading them to the blog, or the colours would look wrong. -->

But it's not all bad: I also discovered that the iPhone's OCR is now good enough to read text from a stitched image (and it's [not the first time][first_time], either).
This still feels like magic to me.

Photography woes aside, this was a really fun project to make.
I love how the final result looks, and I'm going to enjoy seeing it on my wall.
