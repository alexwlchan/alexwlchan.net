Last week I gave a short talk in Cambridge about digital preservation at Wellcome.
It was a quick overview of our processes, practices, and the tools we use.

We can think of a digital archive in three step:

1.  Production.
    How do we choose things to store in the archive?
2.  Storage.
    How do we keep the digital files safe?
3.  Retrieval.
    When somebody wants to see something in the archive, how do we present it?

My talk was a brief overview of each step, and how we're doing them.
If you'd like to read my notes, I've posted a text version of the talk on Stacks (a site where we write about digital happenings at Wellcome Collection).
Even if you don't work in digital preservation, I hope it makes sense and gives you a brief flavour of what I do for a day job.
