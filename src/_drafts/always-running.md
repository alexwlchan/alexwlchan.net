*I'm trying something a bit different today -- fiction. I had an idea for a short story the other evening, and I fleshed it out into a proper piece. I want to get better at writing fiction, and the only way to do that is with practice. I hope you like what I've written!*

When the fire starts, I am already running for the exit.<br/>
I have always been running for the exit.<br/>
One foot lifted, one arm outstretched.<br/>
Frozen mid-stride, but never still.<br/>
I run because that is what I am made to do.<br/>
I run because somebody must show the way.

When the fire starts, the world is thrown into sharp relief.<br/>
Everything unnecessary falls away. <br/>
The noise, the panic, the heat -- nothing touches me.<br/>
I know my purpose.<br/>
I know what I have to do.

I have worked in this theatre since it opened its doors.<br/>
But I am not an actor or an usher or a stagehand.<br/>
I will never receive applause or accolades or awards.<br/>
My job is still important.<br/>
My job is to keep people safe.

When the fire starts, my work begins -- and in a way, it also ends.<br/>
Not because I leave, but because they do. <br/>
For years they have walked past me, hardly noticed me, barely seen me.<br/>
But today, they look up.<br/>
Today, they follow.<br/>
Today, I can do my job.

When the fire starts, they run beneath me.<br/>
Rushing through the doors.<br/>
Rushing towards safety and freedom.<br/>
I do not know how the fire started, or where it is burning, or how it will end.<br/>
I only know that inside is danger, outside is safety, and I am the line between them.

When the fire starts, they leave their bags behind.
Their coats.
Their tickets.<br/>
Some forget their composure.
Some forget their manners. <br/>
But nobody forgets me.

They hear me, though I have no voice.<br/>
They know me, though I have no face.<br/>
They trust me, though I have no name.<br/>
"This way", I cry, without words.<br/>
And they follow.

When the fire starts, I know I will never leave.<br/>
People carry each other -- their friends, their colleagues, the stranger sat next to them.<br/>
But nobody carries me.<br/>
Nobody takes down the sign above the door.<br/>
But I do not need to be carried.<br/>
I do not need to be saved.

When the fire starts, I will keep running.<br/>
Running above their heads.<br/>
Running across the doorway.<br/>
Running in every darkened hall.

I will always be running for the exit, because somebody must.<br/>
I will always be running for the exit, even if I know I can never reach it.<br/>
I will always be running for the exit, because that is how I show you the way.

Hopefully it's clear that this isn't a story about a person, but about the "running man" who appears on [emergency exit signs][wikipedia] around the world.
It's an icon that was first devised by Japanese graphic designer Yukio Ota in 1970 and [adopted as an international symbol][slate] in 1985.

I was sitting in the theatre on Friday evening, waiting for the second half to start, and my eye was drawn to the emergency exit signs.
It struck me that there's a certain sort of tragedy to the running man -- although he guides people to the exit, in a real fire his sign will be burnt to a crisp.
I wrote the first draft on the train home, and I finished it today.

I found the "when the fire starts" line almost immediately, but the early drafts were more vague about the protagonist.
I thought it would be fun to be quite mysterious, to make it a shocking realisation that they're actually a pictogram.
I realised it was too subtle -- I don't think you'd necessarily work out who I was talking about.
I rewrote it so you get the "twist" much earlier, and I think the concept still works.

Another change in the second draft was the line breaks.
I use [semantic linebreaks] in my source code, but they get removed in the rendered site.
A paragraph gets compressed into a single line.
That's fine for most prose, but I realised I was losing something in this short story.
Leaning into the line breaks highlights the repetition and the structure of the words, so I put them back.
It gives the story an almost poetic quality.

I've always been able to find stories in the everyday and the mundane -- a pencil is a rocket ship, a plate is a building, a sock is a cave.
The only surprising thing about this idea is that it's taken me this long to turn the running man into a character in one of my stories.

I really enjoyed writing this, so maybe you'll see more short stories in the future.
I have a lot of ideas, but not much experience turning them into written prose.
