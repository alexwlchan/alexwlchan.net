dress up at home
(I'm writing this article in a full-length gown and a bright red wig, cos that's what I felt like wearing on a quiet sunday evening)
put on something fun or silly, wear for a few hours, take off again

back in height of covid pandemic, I'd often dress up for a friday evening spent at home
I wasn't going anywhere except my sofa to catch up on TV, but dressing up could make it feel like an occasion

I discovered that you can have a lot of fun with a big display and a webcam

when it gets late and it's dark, crank the display up to max brightness
then make the display a funky colour, and you can change the vibes of the office

witchy vibes!

i did this a few times with overlapping windows and the photo booth app, which works well enoug, but kinda clunky
every time I wanted to change colorus, had to switch windows and then bring photo booth back to front

boo

whipped up a quick app today to do this for me
it embeds a webcam view inside a solid colour background, and there's a colour picker to change it

also a "take photo" view, although i doubt i'll use it much
my webcam already struggles, poorly-lit is even worse

code is on github, but extremely ropey
got it working well enough for my machine, dunno if will go back and polish up

app designed for me to play â€“ already plenty good enough!!!
