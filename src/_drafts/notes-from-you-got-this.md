On Saturday, I was at [*You Got This* 2019](https://2019.yougotthis.io/), a conference that bills itself as an event for "juniors on skills needed for a happy, healthy work life".
I'd seen [the schedule](https://2019.yougotthis.io/schedule) on Twitter, thought it looked interesting, and decided to attend on a whim.

All the topics had a strong focus on wellbeing, not technical content.

This post has my lightly edited notes from the conference and the sessions.



## General vibes

Everybody I met was friendly and nice.

All the talks were good, and perhaps more notably, *consistent*.
Usually when I go to a conference, there's at least one or two talks that leave me feeling a bit "meh", and that wasn't the case here.
Every session was interesting, well-presented, and left me with at least a few new ideas.

The emphasis in the introduction was that these are "topics we should be talking about more" -- which is precisely why I decided to go.

I care a lot about running inclusive events, and [have a long list of ideas for doing so](/2018/08/inclusive-conferences/).
For a first-time conference, I was pleased by how many of them they hit:

-   When I arrived, I was asked if I was happy to appear in photographs -- and if not, I could wear a bright yellow lanyard.
    In the introductory remarks, we were all reminded not to take photographs of people with yellow lanyards.

-   All the food was vegan and delicious (except the milk for the coffee, I think), including ice cream in the afternoon break.
    They said several times "if you have other allergies, talk to us", so I'm assuming other food was available if you couldn't eat the default options.

-   The [Code of Conduct](https://underland.xyz/conduct) was prominently featured in the signs, tickets, and the introductory remarks.

-   There was a dedicated quiet room.

-   All the talks were live captioned by somebody in Scotland, who was even kind enough to engage me [in a brief conversation on their screens](https://twitter.com/jorjski/status/1086619834627080194).

-   The ground floor bathroom was gender neutral, and had free sanitary, dental and haircare products for people to take.
    Apparently this is [a feature of the Monzo offices](https://twitter.com/aishpant/status/1086637102908035077), where the conference was held -- very nice indeed!
    Sanitary products are the most important, but dental and haircare are useful too, and a new one to me.

-   The entire day was MC'd by [Scary Boots](https://twitter.com/schrodingerskit), who helped warm up the audience, support the speakers, and keep us all laughing.
    Especially notable when somebody was having A/V issues.

-   There was an [inclusion programme](https://2019.yougotthis.io/inclusion), including a variety of scholarships for people who couldn't afford tickets, travel or childcare.
    And when I bought my ticket, there was an option to pay over the ticket price, contributing to the scholarship pool.

And here's some stuff that felt a little odd:

-   I only saw a handful of name badges, and mostly on speakers, who are more likely to be recognised.
    I'm not sure why they weren't given to everybody.

    The badge design itself was quite good -- rather than pre-printed with wallet names or companies, they were blank with a large space for "name" and "preferred pronouns".

-   I'm told the venue was wheelchair accessible.
    The food and breakout spaces were downstairs

downstairs spaces a bit small

No conference gets inclusivity perfect, and the gold standard for me is still [AlterConf London](/2017/04/lessons-from-alterconf/) -- but this is pretty good, overall.

lanyards + badges

## The talks

These are based on my handwritten notes, which are the bits I found most interesting, not a comprehensive summary of the talks.
They'll give you a flavour, but they're not a substitute for watching the talks.

### Impostor syndrome, perfectionism and anxiety, by [Jo Francetti](https://twitter.com/ThisIsJoFrank)

She started with a story of "Mo", a young developer who was feeling overwhelmed at work, and the sort of things she was feeling.
Wondering if she knows enough, if she's being judged by her co-workers, overworking and ruining her mental health.
It was a good way to set up the topic -- a sort of "Do you recognise this?" moment.

Editor note: I was wondering how she chose the name "Mo", and can't believe it took me to now to spot it.

There are some common issues, which she went through in turn:

-   [**Impostor syndrome.**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)
    An explanation of what it is, how it manifests.

    A new concept to me was [pluralistic ignorance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralistic_ignorance), in which nobody believes something, but everybody believes that everybody else belives it.
    For example, nobody believes that a task is easy, but everybody believes that everybody else finds it easy, and thus impostor syndrome sets in.
    ("Everybody else finds this easy but I can't do it.")

    Another new one on me: [SchrÃ¶dinger's impostor syndrome](https://twitter.com/thisisjofrank/status/988048711937748992).
    The contradiction of

    > My peers are all more intelligent and accomplished than me.

    and

    > My peers are so gullible that I've tricked them into believing I'm one of them.

    Open and frank conversations around our challenges can help combat impostor syndrome.

-   [**Perfectionism.**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectionism_(psychology))
    Expresses itself as catastrophic thinking (an alternative wording to "black and white thinking"), paralysis and procrastination.
    The result is anxiety, overwork and stress.

    We need to remember that perfect is the enemy of good -- we're not expected to come up with a perfect answer every time.
    If you give yourself time to solve a problem (with an explicit deadline), you can work through it.

-   **Anxiety.**
    Don't neglect your mental health!
    Be kind to yourself, and don't just look externally for validation (it's fleeting).

### Knowledge sharing and self-worth, by [Sascha Wolf](https://twitter.com/wolf4earth)

Knowledge sharing can take many forms: blog posts, answering questions, speaking at conferences.

A big part of this talk was Sascha talking about his struggles with depression and exhaustion, and what felt a lot like burnout.
(I don't remember if he actually used the word "burnout".)

He talked about how he built a new frame of mind, and that "we're more than just a walking tech stack"*.
In other words: we shouldn't define ourselves solely by our technical work or our technical skills.
As part of that, he talked about his experiences with therapy, which made me happy.
(I think therapy is a really useful tool, I've been to therapy multiple times, and it's good to hear it discussed on stage.)

A key attribute of a successful team is [psychological safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_safety) -- people feeling like they can take risks, and b supported by their team.

*"Tech enables us, but it doesn't define us."*

How to find knowledge you can share:

-   Keep a TIL (Today I Learned) record
-   Focus on learnings, not failures
-   Ask colleagues what they'd ask you about (i.e. what do they think are your areas of expertise)
-   Document the journey, not the goal

I really liked the framing of this talk: the introduction was "Hi, I'm Sascha", and a list of technical skills and background.
Then at the end of the talk, another slide "Hi, I'm still Sascha", which had a similar list that covered much more of his life.

**There is more to you than your profession.**

### Junior.next(), by Tara Ojo

"career crushes"

everyone has to start as a junior
how do you progress?

juniors:

- state the obvious
- collect evidence
- make a change
- teach people, stretch yourself
- share your opinions
- it's okay not to know
- celebrate your achievements
- perfect your craft

venn diagram:

( !!PANIC!! ( stretch ( comfort ) ) )

you want to be in "stretch", sweet spot
PANIC is bad, a source of stress

base knowledge skills
        d
        e
        p
        t
        h

supporters:

- mentor
- create opportunities
- regular feedback (specific + achievable) (do more/less, start/stop doing, keep doing)
- good pairing
- ask open questions
- invest time

# Self-care beyond the hashtags, by Taylor Elyse-(illegible)

#selfcare hashtag

"ritual builder" -- helpign people build rituals

in order to care for yourself, you need to listen to your body
- stillness
- observation
- reflection

be consciously aware of your body

reflection:

1. pick an interval
2. ask "when did I experience tension"
3. ask "when did I feel supported?"

rituals:

have an emergency toolkit for when you're in a bad moment

- breathing
call a loved one
nature
dance
craft
writing/journalling
give tanks

self-care == listening to your body and responding in the most loving way possible

our self-care needs change, keep listening + responding

# ethics, sam warner

ethical technology

- doesn't make the world a worse place
- benefits the largest number of people in the largest possible way

good/bad is fuzzy

effective altruism
qcon london, yanqing

"we shouldn't be ashamed of being immature if we mature well"

~80% SO survey think would be ethical, but not their responsibility

three principles:

1. people come first
2. create accessible and useful services for everyone
3. more diverse teams => ethical factors

we all make mistkaes
-> what matters is how we get better
facebook example

ethical os toolkit
(do we need one for harassment)

Things to think about:
1. unethical software isn't more profitable
2. don't hide behind contracts
3. you can make a difference (project maven)



# violet peÃ±a, I didn't write down a title

we are problem solvers

reframe independence: bring ability to understand + construct solutions
!= working alone

problem-solving framework:

1. have a plan

  check you understand the problem
  - data
  - unknown
  - conditions

  planning:
  - break down into steps
  - how long will each step take?
  - how can you track progress?

  be honest with yourself + your team
  - are you progressing?

  be aware of how you are performing
  - "I need more time/help/to do something differently"

2.  use your tools

  - change modalities
  - try new tools / debugging technologies

  - find a related problem (by data/condition/unknowns), and solve in a similar way

3.  asking for help

  is a great thing to do!
  - self-knowledge
  - respect for colleagues
  - no self-ego

  "build a voltron" -- a group of people who can help with particular topics

  when?
  - stuck
  - can't get past + stuck
  - need a rethink

  the more certain you are somebody has seen this before, the earlier you can ask for help

  how?
  - give context
  - ask a specific question
  - what have you already tried?
  - thanks

# sam morgan

1. suspicious of the term "junior"
2. advice for supporters

if you say junior, what are you suggesting?
- learning isn't for everyone
- old school
- undervalue skills

in company, you have permission to learn if:
- young
- early-caree
- not expected to deliver

(false dichotomy)

how to build learning structures:

1.  context
    - whiteboarding + diagramm9â³ sessions
    - link to domain (every ticket should link to an end-user case)
    - everything is a learning exercise
    - time / mind unblocking / keywords / engagement

2.  goals

  - locke "a theory of goal setting and task performance"
  - what can I say about myself
  - specific/aspirational/expected/believed

3.  tasks

4.  reources

    summary of reading/you/prepared exercises
    be socratic, i.e. ask questions

    answering Qs -> robs somebody the chance to ever learn the answer
    increase their power to ask questions

    socratic -- build a link library
    keep focussed

5.    assessment

    concrete -- if the internet can answer, ignore ("what is js syntax for a function")
    concepts -- interesting conversations/discussion ("what is a function")
    skills -- process / pairing + observe ("writing a. good function")
    + behaviours

6.  feedback

    have a structure for feedback

    1.  require intentionality
        what do you want feedback on?

    2.  keep it tight

    3.  demand iteration

        - implement feedback + come back for me feedback (cf exams)

how r u going to transform the businesses you work in?
