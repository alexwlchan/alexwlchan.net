Earlier today, I gave a talk for the [the Open Life Science Program][openlife] about agile and iterative project management.
I was talking about how READMEs serve as the first point of contact for a project; how they get new users interested in and excited about the project.

The cohort calls are recorded, and I'll add a link to the video when it's posted.
In the meantime, you can download my slides [as a PDF][pdfslides], and I'll add some notes shortly.
