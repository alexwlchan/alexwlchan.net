I gave a talk at PyCon UK today about [*Sans I/O programming patterns*](https://pretalx.com/pyconuk-2019/talk/8HMJJL/).
Thanks to everybody who came to the talk, or said nice things about it afterward!
It really does mean a lot.

I've just [uploaded the slides as a PDF](/files/pyconuk_2019_sans_io.pdf).
When the video is uploaded to YouTube, I'll put a link here.

If you found the talk interesting, some further links you might enjoy:

*   [Writing I/O-Free (Sans-I/O) Protocol Implementations](https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/how-to-sans-io.html)
*   [Building Protocol Libraries the Right Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cC3_jGwl_U), a talk at PyCon US 2019
*   [Designing an async API, from sans-I/O on up](https://snarky.ca/designing-an-async-api-from-sans-i-o-on-up/), by Brett Cannon
*   [SansIO â€“ Migrating microservices to async](https://smarketshq.com/sansio-migrating-microservices-to-asyncio-b97c69e391b2)

I'm not going to share slides from the lightning talk -- there's not much reference material in the slides, and I don't think it would translate well into a written format.
Watch the video when it's up!
