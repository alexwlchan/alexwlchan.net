One of the most consistent design elements of this site is the header, which is made of tiled squares in varying shades of a page's tint colour.
It's a subtle bit of texture that makes the header a bit more interesting.

{%
  picture
  filename="header_2025.png"
  width="750"
  alt="The site header, which is made of small tiling squares in slightly varying shades of red."
%}

I added this to the design in 2016, and I've never found another pattern that I like more -- but every so often I experiment with something different.
