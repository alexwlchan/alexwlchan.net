summary: We are better off when the same topic is represented in multiple, different archives.

*Preface: this post is a personal opinion, and not endorsed by my employer.*

Here's a truth that anybody working in cultural heritage can tell you: **archives are inherently political**.
It's easy to imagine an archive as a neutral, objective collection of stuff; simply a container for historical objects, presented without bias or opinion.
But that isn't the case.

Archives don't just accept any material that gets donated.
Archivists make choices about what to include and what to exclude.
Those choices mean some groups will be over or underrepresented in the archival record.

And an archive isn't a passive container -- objects are catalogued and contextualised.
Every object will have a title and a description, to make it easier for future researches to find.
Different archivists will describe the same object in different ways.
Their expertise, their knowledge, the other material in the archive -- all these things feed into how an object is presented.

**When dealing with archives, there are power structures in play.**

Most archives have a theme: maybe a topic, or an institution, or a person.
That theme helps inform what gets accepted -- for example, a transport archive might take a collection of old timetables, but decline some leaflets about gardening.
In turn, the people who work on that archive can have more detailed knowledge of a theme, so they can write more in-depth descriptions and catalogue records.

Often different archives will overlap in their theme -- the same object could be in-scope for multiple archives.
This is a good thing!
It means we get a wider range of perspectives on the theme, and voices that are underrepresented in one archive might be better represented in another.
People can choose where to donate their material -- based on where they think it will be best looked after, most accurately catalogued, the history understood, and so on.

For example, if you have something about black men in London during the AIDS crisis, I can think of at least three different archives and that might be interested.
Do you want it to be part of the history of LGBT people in London (the Bishopsgate Institute)?
Or the black community in the UK (the Black Cultural Archive)?
Or wider medical history (Wellcome Collection)?
You choose.

**Archives and history flourish with diversity, and that applies to the institutions as much as the records they keep.**

All that means I get nervous when I see one archive hoovering up all the material or mindshare for a given theme.
Monocultures and monopolies are bad, and that's as true in archives as anywhere else.
Forget tearing down status, that's how history gets forgotten -- when only one group gets to decide what's worth keeping.

I feel like I'm watching this happen in our digital spaces -- consider the Internet Archive, or the amount of fannish material on AO3.
Neither of them are unique in what they do, but they take a huge amount of mindshare -- to many people, they are *the* archive in their particular space.
(Heck, I work in digital preservation, and I couldn't tell you the name of another web archiving project without googling.)

Both of them have been in the news recently -- AO3 for a statement about racism in fandom, the Internet Archive for their [soon-to-be-closed digital library](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/books/internet-archive-national-emergency-library-coronavirus.html?smid=tw-nytbooks&smtyp=cur) -- and I can't help but wonder if it’s a good idea to put so much Internet/fannish history into a single pot.

What happens to the stuff they don't take?

Don't get me wrong -- I admire both of them and the work they do, I just wish they weren’t quite so "we're the only player in town" in their respective spaces.
Having more archives with a similar amount of mindshare would be healthy for all sorts of reasons.

I have no solutions or clever fixes here.
This is just something at the back of my mind whenever IA or AO3 are in the news, regardless of how exactly they’re upsetting people this week. We’d all be better off if there were other archives with similar mindshare.
