On Monday evening, about two hundred Mincefluencers descended on the Fortune Theatre for "Operation Human Thermos", a fan gathering to celebrate *Operation Mincemeat*, [a musical] that gives us all the warm and fuzzies.
A lot of people dressed in cosplay to mark the occasion, and I joined in the fun.
(If you want to see pictures, Harry has a [thread of great photos][twitter] on Twitter.)

Accompanying me was Flemingo, a hand-puppet flamingo who's become a constant companion when I go to the show.
(Why a flamingo?
Because of [one verse in a single song][gtb] that has turned the humble flamingo into an icon in the fandom.)

Both of us were wearing bow ties to cosplay as Ian Fleming, who's both a character in the musical and the co-author of a memo that laid the seeds for the real-life operation.
And Ian Fleming was a part-time novelist, part-time spy, so it made sense for us to be carrying a stack of his books.

This led to a series of over-arsed props: the Collected Works of Ian Flemingo.
These are a collection of postcards based on the real James Bond books:

I got the idea over Christmas, and annoyed my family by coming up with increasingly tenuous ideas for James <s>Bond</s> Bird puns.
There are so many, and I could only make a selection â€“ I printed eight, but I have at least twenty more I didn't use.

The design of the covers are loosely based on a set of [hardback editions], without the fancy art.
For the silhouettes, I turned to [PhyloPic], a site I've had bookmarked for years and finally had a reason to use.
