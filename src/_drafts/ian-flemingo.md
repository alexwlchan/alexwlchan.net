On Monday evening, about two hundred Mincefluencers descended on the Fortune Theatre for "Operation Human Thermos", a fan gathering to celebrate *Operation Mincemeat*, [a musical] that gives us all the warm and fuzzies.
A lot of people dressed in cosplay to mark the occasion, and I joined in the fun.
(If you want to see pictures, Harry has a [thread of great photos][twitter] on Twitter.)

Accompanying me was Flemingo, a hand-puppet flamingo who's become a constant companion when I go to the show.
(Why a flamingo?
Because of [one verse in a single song][gtb] that has turned the humble flamingo into an icon in the fandom.)

Both of us were wearing bow ties to cosplay as Ian Fleming, who's both a character in the musical and the co-author of a memo that laid the seeds for the real-life operation.
And Ian Fleming was a part-time novelist, part-time spy, so it made sense for us to be carrying a stack of his books.

This led to a series of over-arsed props: the Collected Works of Ian Flemingo.
These are a collection of postcards based on the real James Bond books:

I got the idea over Christmas, and annoyed my family by coming up with increasingly tenuous ideas for James <s>Bond</s> Bird puns.
This was lots of fun, and I came up with so many ideas -- for every one you see, there are two more I didn't use.

The design of the covers are loosely based on a set of [hardback editions], without the fancy art.
For the images, I turned to [PhyloPic], a site I bookmarked years ago and finally had a reason to use.
It provides free silhouette images of animals and plants, and I was able to get a good set of bird images which are all under a CC0 license.

I'd like to say the rainbow spread was intentional, but really I just kept picking colours I hadn't used yet – I didn't arrange them in this order until I had them printed.

On the other side of the cards, I wrote pun-filled blurbs that are based loosely on the original books.
I got the original blurbs from Amazon listings, then stuffed them with puns.
At one point I did consider including testimonials from characters in the show, but I didn't have space.

The books are published by "El Otro Editora", a reference to ["El Otro Periodico"][eop], a fan-produced newspaper.
The price is "6d", which is the one mistake that really irks me – I meant the cost to be a ha'penny, but instead it's half a shilling.
Oops.
(Why a ha'penny?
There's a line in the show.)

My favourite touch is the barcodes in the corner.
This is what makes it feel like a "real" book to me – and every book has a unique barcode, and they can be scanned!

Initially I picked random numbers as the ISBNs, but I got worried about where they might be pointing – maybe I'd accidentally pick a real ISBN that pointed at an offensive book?

Then I looked for ISBNs that could be used safely.
For example, I know there are [telephone numbers][ofcom] that are reserved for fictional purposes, so a phone number that appears in a TV show won't accidentally lead to a deluge of calls for the person on the other end.
But although lots of ISBNs are used for fiction books, there aren't any ranges reserved for fiction*al* books.
(And yes, I found the [ISBN specifications][specs] to see if there were any ranges reserved for this purpose.
This project is nothing if not ridiculous.)

Finally, I did the obvious thing – I just dropped in the ISBNs for the original Ian Fleming books.
So if you scan the barcodes, you'll find a James Bond book.

I printed the cards themselves using [InstantPrint], who did a great job – the cards feel nice in the hand, and they were delivered quickly on a tight deadline.

Most of my work is purely digital, so I always enjoy when I get to actually hold something I've made.
In the week leading up to the event, I found myself taking them out of my bag and just turning them over in my hands as I admired the shiny, shiny thing.
I don't expect to print more of these books, but I can see myself doing more custom postcards in future -- it's nice to have physical souvenirs in an increasingly online world.

I gave out a bunch of the postcards as OHT souvenirs on Monday, and people liked them!
I also got to gave some sets to the cast at stage door today, which got rid of the rest of the prints.
I had fun making them, and I'm so glad that people are enjoying them.

Small flashes of joy, indeed.
