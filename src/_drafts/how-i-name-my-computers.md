Apple released some [new Mac minis][mac_mini] last week, and I decided it was finally time to replace my aging Intel iMac.
I've already set up a lot of the machine, and this blog post is one of the first things I'll make with it.

Buying a new computer means choosing a good name.
I've named all of my computers, and my younger self picked a naming scheme that has lasted surprisingly well.

## P is for Personal computers

All my personal computers are named after figures from mythology that start with the letter P, mostly Greek.
The names I remember is where the name was thematically appropriate:

*   I had a MacBook Air called [**Persephone**][Persephone], the Greek goddess who lived a dual existence.
    Every year she'd spend six months in the underworld, six months on the surface.
    
    This laptop had a similarly dual existence.
    Every summer, Apple would preview a new version of Mac OS X at WWDC, and they issued developer betas for testing.
    I installed those betas, and my Mac became very buggy and crashy.
    They released it to the public in the autumn, I stopped using the developer betas, and my machine became a lot more stable.
    I swore off the developer betas -- right until WWDC came round the next year.
    
    (I was young and foolhardy.
    Do not install the developer betas on your only Mac.)

    Persephone is my favourite mythological figure, and I've always thought of her story as a metaphor for non-binary gender or genderfluidity.
    One of my long-unfinished drafts is expanding on that idea, and maybe incorporating it into some new stories.

*   My next Mac was called [**Poseidon**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poseidon).
    God of the sea
    I wanted a machine that was more stable, which wasn't crashing half the year.
    I stopped installing developer betas.
    
    Now I think about it, Poseidon isn't really depicted as a stable character in myth -- but it made sense in my head at the time.
    I'd been reading a lot about lighthouses and lifeboats, standing firm against the unpredictabilty of the sea.
    Somewhere in my head, stability became associated with the sea, and that's how I got to Poseidon.

*   I owned one of the [12â€³ MacBooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-inch_MacBook).
    It was plagued by reliability issues, but I got lucky -- it lasted six years before the keyboard finally broke.
    I still miss the lightness in my bag.

    That laptop was notorious for only having one port, so I named it [**Polyphemus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphemus), the one-eyed Cyclops who was blinded by Odysseus in the *Odyssey*.
    
*   Poseidon broke in an extremely unfortunate accident when I moved house, which saw it falling three feet and faceplanting on my backup hard drives.
    I was *very* glad to have offsite backups that day.
    
    I replaced it with another iMac, which I named **Phoenix** -- as the bird rises from the ashes, so this computer rose from the shards of its predecessor.

*   My new Mac Mini is called [**Phaenna**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaenna).
    She's a minor character in Greek mythology, which felt strangely appropriate for such a small computer.
    She doesn't take up much space in the Greek canon, and this machine doesn't take up much space on my desk.


## S is for storage

The setup process was smooth -- a lot of my config is synced between computers using GitHub and iCloud, so I got to a working setup very quickly.
I had this site building within an hour of turning on the machine, and this blog post is the first thing I'll make with it.
