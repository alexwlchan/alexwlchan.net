I've recently completed another cross-stitch piece, which is now hanging on my wall.
It's a collection of brightly coloured squares, each with its own geometric pattern:

<a href="/images/2022/P8150078.jpg">
  <img src="/images/2022/P8150078_1x.jpg" srcsrt="/images/2022/P8150078_1x.jpg 1x, /images/2022/P8150078_2x.jpg 2x" class="fullwidth_img" alt="A cross-stitch piece embroided on a brown fabric, with twenty brightly-coloured squares laid out in a grid. Each square uses a couple of colours (red, blue, green, yellow, white, or black) and has a simple repeating pattern. For example, one square is yellow with repeating black and red vertical lines; another has a red background with concentric white diamonds.">
</a>

I got the pattern from [issue 6 of Xstitch Magazine][issue6], and it was made by Arlene Cohen, who goes by the handle [WorksByABC].
The pattern includes a full list of materials and threads, and I got it mounted by [Landseer Picture Framing].

The magazine entry explains that these patterns weren't chosen at random -- they were taken from an 1856 design book *The Grammar of Ornament*, and based on patterns found in Egyptian art.
I found a [digitised copy of the book][digitised], which has several plates featuring similar squares.

<style>
  #grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: auto auto auto;
    grid-gap: 10px;
  }
</style>

<div id="grid">
  <img src="/images/2022/h1380-513ce.jpg" alt="A printed page with a grid of squares, each showing a repetitive pattern. The details are smaller than on cross-stitch -- some of the lines are very fine.">

</div>

I can spot some of the squares from the cross-stitch pattern in the digitised plates, but not all of them -- I wonder if they're from elsewhere, or if they were created by WorksByABC?

One of the reasons I enjoy cross-stitch is that I can just follow the instructions in the pattern, and soon I have something that looks nice.
This piece exemplifies that more than most -- once I'd worked out the repetition, I could keep stitching without having to refer back to the cross-stitch pattern.
Indeed, I even spotted a few mistakes in the cross-stitch pattern.

This isn't my biggest or most interesting piece, but it was fun to make and it adds a splash of colour to a previously blank wall.
