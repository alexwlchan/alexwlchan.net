I was recently visiting Vermont for a work trip -- my first time in the USA since I was a child.
I was drawn to the license plates on passing cars, and how they look different to the cars I'm used to.

Whenever I visit new places, I enjoy looking for the tiny bits of infrastructure and design that make life different – stuff that everybody who lives there is used to, but which is novel or unusual to me.
The shape of Berlin's telephone booths.
How pedestrian crossings work in Dublin.
The colour of Slovenian post boxes.

These details are only small, but they add up to give every a place a unique feel.
Often they don't get written down or recorded, because "everybody knows" how these things work, and they don't seem remarkable to somebody who experiences them every day.
It's hard to know these things without visiting, because so few people think they're worth sharing -- and many of them are lost to time, forgotten as places change and evolve.

A few things struck me about license plates on American cars.
(Aside from the phrase "license plate", which itself sounds odd to me -- in Britain, I'm used to calling them ["number plates"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plates_of_the_United_Kingdom).)

## Some cars don't have a license plate on the front of the car

In the UK, every car must have a number plate on both the front and back of the car.
In the US, it varies by state -- some states require both plates, other states only require a rear license plate.

I'd seen US cars without a front license plate in TV shows and movies, and I thought maybe it was a Hollywood thing -- special cars used for filming -- but no, it turns out that's perfectly legal in 19 US states.
I only realised this was a thing a few weeks ago, when Casey Liss mentioned "front plate states" in [ATP #590](https://atp.fm/590).
Until then, I just took it for granted that all cars have plates on the front and back, because that was what seemed "normal" to me.

I didn't see any cars without front license plates while I was in Vermont, but I did see some cars with ["Vermont Strong" commemorative plates](https://dmv.vermont.gov/vermontstrong23), plus a few with political slogans I didn't catch.

    To my British eyes, this car looks like it’s sitting on a showroom lot – even though I know it must be from a state that doesn’t require front license plates.
    It just feels <em>wrong</em>.

## US license plates are full of visual variety

In the UK and Europe, the appearance of number plates is tightly regulated -- they don't quite specify a font, but [there are rules](https://www.gov.uk/displaying-number-plates/rules-number-plates) around letter shape, spacing, colour, and so on.
This creates a strong visual consistency, and don't tell you much about where a car comes from.

(While writing this article, I was reminded that the first four digits of non-personalised UK number plates [follow a fixed format](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/359317/INF104_160914.pdf) that can tell you roughly where and when a car was registered, but this is a less obvious system that requires knowing a number/letter code.)

The USA has no such consistency -- license plates are an explosion of colour, font, and design choices.
Every state has a different design, some multiple.
Pretty much every license plate had the name of the state on it, and often there were additional text or graphics.

A few that stood out to me: "In God We Trust" with an illustration of some oranges (Florida); "Live Free or Die" (New Hampshire); "Green Mountain State" (Vermont).
The plates in Vermont were a distinctive shade of green with white text, which matched the scenery.
I didn't get good pictures from a moving car, but I found examples on Wikimedia Commons:

    Examples of some styles of license plate that I saw a lot of.
    We drove from Vermont into New Hampshire, and at times I saw a 50/50 split of plates -- I wasn't sure which state we were in.

Personally I find the extra text and graphics distracting, and I think they make the license plates harder to read -- but I'm not used to this style.
This is a visceral reaction against something different, not an objective assessment.

I can definitely see how it adds a sense of personality and identity to a car, in a way that UK number plates are very generic and dull.
I see the occasional bumper sticker when driving in the UK, but this is much bolder and brighter.

I didn't realise this variety was a thing until I was on US roads -- although I'm sure I've seen different plates in US media, it wasn't until I saw dozens of cars next to each other that it jumped out at me.
Standardised number plate designs are another aspect of my life that felt universal, but were really just familiar.

## Counting plates from differing states

While I was driving with [Jessamyn](https://jessamyn.info) around Vermont, she pointed out a couple of more unusual license plates -- she was keeping a list of out-of-state plates she saw while out driving.
Because she lives in the US, she can recognise a lot of the plates from a distance -- I had to squint my eyes and read the text, because it's all new to me. 
(I did all this from the passenger seat, don't worry!)

On the drive back to the airport, from Vermont to Boston, I decided to start my own list.
I was surprised by how many different states I spotted -- in three hours, I saw plates from two Canadian provinces (Ontario and Quebec) and twenty-six US states.

    I took this photo while waiting in traffic at the airport.
    I thought this would be my final list, then I got six more states within a few minutes.
    Airports and rental car lots are probably hotspots for out-of-state cars.

My American geography is lousy and I have no intuition for where these states actually are, so when I got home I plotted them on a map.
This helped me see the patterns more clearly.

These are the states whose plates I spotted (with the states we drove through shown in green):

Drawing this map was another educational experience -- although I've seen a map of the US states lots of times, I'd never really looked at it properly.

Given that we were driving in the northeast, it makes sense that most of the states I saw are from the eastern part of the country.
I'd never realised how much denser the states are in the east versus the west -- they really are packed in tight.
Maybe this is because European colonists arrived on the east coast, and so those areas were more densely populated when the state lines were drawn?

California (far left) is a notable outlier, and I was surprised by just how many cars I saw with those plates -- by the end of the trip, I could spot the red faux-handwriting quite easily.
Google tells me that California has the most people of any state, which might explain why I saw so many of their cars despite being on the far side of the country.

Washington (top left) is another outlier, and I wonder if I made a mistake here -- I know I saw a plate labelled "Washington", but it turns out Washington DC has [its own license plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plates_of_Washington,_D.C.).
Since DC is on the east coast, it's much more likely I saw a car from there than from a state on other end of the country.
Unfortunately I don't remember what the plate looked like, so I can't be sure.

While I was in the US, I assumed it was just states who got to issue license plates.
Now I know that's wrong, I wonder if there are other exceptions.
Are there any other federal districts or smaller-than-state entities who get to issue their own license plates, or is Washington DC special?

I've left Alaska and Hawaii off the map because I didn't see any of their plates.
It's a long way to drive a car from Alaska, and it's an expensive job to ship a car from Hawaii -- those cars must be pretty rare in the contiguous US.

Drawing this single map has probably helped me internalise more about US geography than anything else.
For the first time I'm an active participant in the map -- I'm drawing my own data and looking at patterns and causes, not just passively observing data drawn by somebody else.

## License plates are fractally interesting

This is only scratching the surface of the complexity of license plates.
There's so much more history, and variety, and design, all of which would be fun to research and write about if I had more time -- but I have to stop somewhere.

I describe topics like this as *"fractally interesting"*.
However deep you dig, however much you learn, there's more to uncover.

This is why I love looking for the seemingly insignificant details in which life in foreign places differs from mine -- it might seem small at first, but there's always something interesting to learn.
