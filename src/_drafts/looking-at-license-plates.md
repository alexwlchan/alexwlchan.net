summary: |
  On a recent trip to the US, I spent a lot of time looking at the license plate of other cars as they drove by.

I was recently visiting Vermont for a work trip -- my first time in the USA since I was a child.
I was drawn to the license plates on passing cars, and how they look different to the cars I'm used to.

Whenever I visit new places, I enjoy looking for the tiny bits of infrastructure and design that make life different – stuff that everybody who lives there is used to, but which is novel or unusual to me.
The shape of Berlin's telephone booths.
How pedestrian crossings work in Dublin.
The colour of Slovenian post boxes.

These details are only small, but they add up to give every a place a unique feel.
Often they don't get written down or recorded, because "everybody knows" how these things work, and they don't seem remarkable to somebody who experiences them every day.
It's hard to know these things without visiting, because so few people think they're worth sharing -- and many of them are lost to time, forgotten as places change and evolve.

A few things struck me about license plates on American cars.
(Aside from the phrase "license plate", which itself sounds odd to me -- in Britain, I'm used to calling them ["number plates"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plates_of_the_United_Kingdom).)

## Some cars don't have a license plate on the front of the car

In the UK, every car must have a number plate on both the front and back of the car.
In the US, it varies by state -- some states require both plates, other states only require a rear license plate.

I'd seen US cars without a front license plate in TV shows and movies, and I thought maybe it was a Hollywood thing -- special cars used for filming -- but no, it turns out that's perfectly legal in 19 US states.
I only realised this was a thing a few weeks ago, when Casey Liss mentioned "front plate states" in [ATP #590](https://atp.fm/590).
Until then, I just took it for granted that all cars have plates on the front and back, because that was what seemed "normal" to me.

I didn't see any cars without front license plates while I was in Vermont, but I did see some cars with ["Vermont Strong" commemorative plates](https://dmv.vermont.gov/vermontstrong23), plus a few with political slogans I didn't catch.

    To my British eyes, this car looks like it’s sitting on a showroom lot – even though I know it must be from a state that doesn’t require front license plates.
    It just feels <em>wrong</em>.

And the placement of plates isn't the only thing decided by states.

## US license plates are full of visual variety

In the UK and Europe, the appearance of number plates is tightly regulated -- they don't quite specify a font, but [there are rules](https://www.gov.uk/displaying-number-plates/rules-number-plates) around letter shape, spacing, colour, and so on.
This creates a strong visual consistency, and don't tell you much about where a car comes from.

(While writing this article, I was reminded that the first four digits of non-personalised UK number plates [follow a fixed format](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/359317/INF104_160914.pdf) that can tell you roughly where and when a car was registered, but this is a less obvious system that requires knowing a number/letter code.)

    The font style is very typical of UK plates; the country indicator on the left-hand side is a common feature of European plates.

The USA has no such consistency -- license plates are an explosion of colour, font, and design choices.
Every state has a different design, some multiple.
Pretty much every license plate had the name of the state on it, and often there were additional text or graphics.

A few that stood out to me: "In God We Trust" with an illustration of some oranges (Florida); "Live Free or Die" (New Hampshire); "The Garden State" (Vermont).
The plates in Vermont were a distinctive shade of green with white text, which matched the scenery.
I didn't get good pictures from a moving car, but I found examples on Wikimedia Commons:

<style>
  .grid_2up {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
    grid-gap: 10px;
  }
</style>

    We drove from Vermont into New Hampshire, and at times I saw a 50/50 split of plates -- I wasn't sure which state we were in.

Personally I find the extra text and graphics distracting, and I think they make the license plates harder to read -- but I'm not used to this style.

e.g. how pedestrian crossings work in ireland
post boxes in slovenia
telephone booths in berlin
that sort of thing

US is land of the car
after i got over the way parking meters work
(one meter per space -- only ever seen Pay & Display in UK)
noticed license plates
(the fact that they call them that is weird, because in uk it's "number plate")

1. not always at front and back of car
  seen on tv in past but thought it was a hollywood thing

  "front-plate state"
  https://catatp.fm/2024/06/06/atp590.mp3/
  saw a few cars without front plates, a few with political slogans like "vermont strong"
  so unusual to me!

2.  so many different license plates!
    again in UK there is a very standard, regimented design
    but dozens of different plate styles

while I was driving with Jessamyn she pointed out a couple of unusual designs from states far from Vermont
she was keeping a list of them

on the drive back to the airport, decided to keep them too
~3 hours vermont to boston, saw 26 states and two canadian provinces

have no US geography so plotted on a map
east coast fairly obvious
several outliers: California (!),
Washington DC instead of State, maybe?
surprised not many central states
