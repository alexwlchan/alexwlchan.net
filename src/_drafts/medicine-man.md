On Thursday evening, I went to a [Queering the Collection] event at work.
It's part of a series of events to mark [the closing of *Medicine Man*][beyond], and to reflect on the legacy of the objects it displays.
I had a fun evening -- Nan and Tabs put together an interesting set of activities, that was more thoughtful and challenging than I'd expected.
I'd only skimmed the event description, so I was expecting something more akin to a tour or a lecture.

At the start of the session, we were invited to wander around the exhibit, and find objects that reminded us of being queer (I forget the exact wording).
Nan read us [a quote from Bell Hooks][bellhooks] about "queer" being an expansive, broad-ranging term, and then we were left to wander.
