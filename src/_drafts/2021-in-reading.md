title: My favourite books from 2021
summary: The seven books I most enjoyed in the last year.
tags: books
---

I read 52 books this year, which is a pleasingly round number.
I don't set a reading target so there's no "pass/fail" grade for the year, but I'm happy with that.

2021 was when I fell back in love with audiobooks, after many years away.
As a kid, I had a box full of tape cassettes with my favourite books, but they didn't follow me to the digital era.
Podcasts stepped in to fill the void left by books, and I'm only starting to adjust the balance.

This was no doubt helped by the excellent audiobook lending programme from [my local library][herts].
Their player app is [pretty good][app], and I can download DRM-free MP3s if I want to use a different app.

I've found audiobooks are much easier to listen to when there's a strong narrative – usually fiction – which may be why I read more fiction than non-fiction this year.

I write notes on individual books at [books.alexwlchan.net][books], usually straight after I'm finished.

These are my seven favourites from 2021, all of which I'd recommend:

      <strong><a href="https://books.alexwlchan.net/reviews/the-galaxy-and-the-ground-within/"><em>The Galaxy and the Ground Within</em></a>, by Becky Chambers.</strong>
      The final entry in the <em>Wayfarers</em> series of space operas, which I adore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The residents of a space hotel have to make friends after an external crisis means they&rsquo;re stuck inside (sound familiar?).
      It&rsquo;s a variety of non-human, alien species, and they use the time together to learn more about each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love how truly alien they feel &ndash; different social structures, cultural habits, physical biology &ndash; and it made me reflect on my own norms.

      <strong><a href="https://books.alexwlchan.net/reviews/loveless"><em>Loveless</em></a>, by Alice Oseman.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a novel about a girl who goes to university looking for &ldquo;one true love&rdquo;, but comes to realise she&rsquo;s actually ace-aro &ndash; after learning what ace-aro actually is (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexuality">asexual</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_orientation#Aromanticism">aromantic</a>).
      A tale of self-discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;m somewhere in the ace-aro probability cloud and this book felt very authentic to me.
      It resonated strongly (almost painfully so), and I only wish I&rsquo;d been able to read something like this when I was at university.

    <p>
      <strong><a href="https://books.alexwlchan.net/reviews/the-underground-railroad"><em>The Underground Railroad</em></a>, by Colson Whitehead.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      An alt history novel about the American slave trade which reimagines the so-called &ldquo;underground railroad&rdquo; of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_Railroad">secret routes and safe houses</a> as a literal railroad.
      It follows Cora, a woman who escapes a cotton plantation in Georgia.
      It&rsquo;s unflinching about the horrors of slavery, in a way that feels real and grounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      There&rsquo;s a TV show based on the book, which is why I spotted it, but I haven&rsquo;t watched the show.

      <strong><a href="https://books.alexwlchan.net/reviews/the-only-plane-in-the-sky"><em>The Only Plane in the Sky</em></a>, by Garrett M. Graff.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t have strong memories of 9/11 because I was quite young when it happened, and this book helped me understand why it left such an impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      It&rsquo;s a collection of quotes from different people, carefully combined into a single timeline.
      The audiobook has a cast of actors interspersed with real audio, and I think it worked better than if I&rsquo;d read it on the printed page.

      <strong><a href="https://books.alexwlchan.net/reviews/think-black/"><em>Think Black</em></a>, by Clyde W. Ford.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A memoir from the son of the first Black systems engineer at IBM.
      It&rsquo;s a powerful account of the intersection of race relations and the tech industry, and the struggles of being a Black man at a predominantly white company.
    </p>
    <p>
      The author also worked at IBM, and he contrasts his experience with his father&rsquo;s &ndash; what was different, and what was unchanged.

      <strong><a href="https://books.alexwlchan.net/reviews/written-in-the-stars/"><em>Written in the Stars</em></a>, by Alexandria Bellefleur.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A queer rom-com with Elle (a self-confident astrologist looking for love) and Darcy (a guarded actuary who&rsquo;s sworn off dating).
      After a disastrous blind date, they start fake dating, but realise neither of them have fake feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fell in love with all the characters and I adored this book.
      It&rsquo;s part of a trilogy, so the subsequent books are on my reading list for 2022.

      <strong><a href="https://books.alexwlchan.net/reviews/your-computer-is-on-fire/"><em>Your Computer is on Fire</em></a>, edited by Thomas S. Mullaney, Benjamin Peters, Mar Hicks, and Kavita Philip.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A series of essays about technology and computing, countering the myth of a technological utopia, and explaining the inequality and marginalisation caused by the current tech industry.
      It&rsquo;s a strong collection which doesn&rsquo;t pull its punches, and which I&rsquo;d recommend to anyone working in tech.
