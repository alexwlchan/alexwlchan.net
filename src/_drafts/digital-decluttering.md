**I’ve accumulated a lot of data, and most of it is clutter. I’ve been taking steps to store less data, organise it better, and make it easier to find the things I care about.**

i spent a lot of my early internet days in fannish spaces
fanfic, fan art, podfic
if you spend time in those spaces, quickly learn to save stuff if you like it
internet is notoriously fickle, stuff disappears
i can still remember the disappointment of going to read a story i liked, only to find all traces of it had vanished from the internet
every fan learns to be an amateur archivist

this was not an uncommon experience
youtube videos became private
a formative podcast whose domain name lapsed
articles that were deleted
or stuff that got de-indexed by search

(in hindsight unsurprising i have a career in digipres)

and so at some point i started saving everything
storage is abundant and cheap, and I could afford to keep copies of everything i looked at, in case I wanted to look at it again
i saved web pages and videos and audio files, and i wrote scripts to suck down as much as possible, so I'd never lose anything again
i always thought "what if i want to go back to this someday"

the gigabytes stacked up and became terabytes
at peak my collection spanned 15 years of links and over two million files

in hindsight, i didn't need 90% of what i was saving, maybe less
abundance of storage meant i didn't have to be picky

all this data might have been cheap to store, but came with cognitive overload
i was still losing stuff in the pile, because too difficult to find
anything
i was keeping the diamonds, but also keeping a mountain of coal
some of this stuff i do want to look at again, but awful lot not

i knew i wanted to reduce my storage
i had nearly 6TB of data, spread over several external disks
wanted to simplify, ideally enough to fit on a single internal drive

As I save new material, I’,m trying to be more intentional about what I keep. Before I save something, I ask myself: *“when will you want to look at this again?* If I can’t imagine a scenario in which I’d want to look at it again, I don’t save it.

That’s slowing the influx of new data, but there’s still the backlog of all the data I’ve collected over twenty years. I’ve been gradually pruning it, and building better tools to organise it. It’s slow going, because there’s no easy way to automate this – ultimately, I have to look at every item and decide if it’s worth keeping.

[[ Emily Gorcenski ]]

It took me twenty years to build this pile of data, so I’m not going to clear it in a day. I have to pace myself – this is precisely the sort of task that my hyperfocus could latch onto and while away endless time.

I’ve already reviewed all of the photos I’ve taken, the videos I’ve saved, and the podcasts I’ve saved. I’ve shed thousands of files. I’ve saved a decent chunk of disk space, but more importantly, I can now find the items I actually care about.

Many nerds treat it as inevitable that your data gets bigger over time; that you’ll always need more storage than you did in the past. It’s taking time to get there, but I’m trying to resist that.

The first computer I remember using is an iMac G3.
It had a 4GB hard drive, a fact I was only dimly aware of at the time.
I was just using it to play games and make silly Word documents, so I was hardly filling the disk.
I didn't know what hard drives were, and I didn't think about storage.
As far as I was concerned, 4GB was plenty.

Fast forward two decades, and the world has changed.
I'm writing this article on a MacBook Air with a 256GB SSD – 60 times more than that original iMac, and many people would call this "small".
Storage has become much cheaper, and we use much more of it.

The last time I bought an external hard drive, I paid just £83 for a 4TB disk – 1000 times more than the iMac.
I picked the largest portable drive that was available, because more storage is always better, right?

I've never experienced scarcity of digital storage.
I've never had to delete files because I was running out of disk space.
I've always been able to keep as much data as I wanted, for minimal cost.

When I bought my last external hard drive, I paid £83 for a 4TB disk – the largest portable drive I could buy at the time. You can always use more storage, right? Why not get the biggest disk I could? I actually bought three of those disks, for a total of 12TB – of which I’ve used maybe half.

<!-- # part 1: clearing my digital clutter

when I bought my last external hard drive, I bought a 4TB disk -- largest portable drive I could buy

then you go to the cloud, where storage is silly cheap

I’ve never experienced scarcity of my digital storage. I’ve never had to delete files because I was running out of disk space. I’ve always been able to keep as much data as I wanted for a near-trivial cost.

But I have experienced data loss, especially of online content. I spent my early Internet years in fandom, and I learnt that if you like something, you have to save your own copy. Sites go down, works get removed, you can’t find stuff again. Every fan learns to be an amateur archivist, to preserve the things they care about.

When I started saving stuff, I kept everything, because storage is cheap and easy, right? And because I had so much storage, I began looking for ways to fill it – downloading photos, videos, podcasts, web pages – all to use this massive disk I’d acquired.

In hindsight, I didn’t need 90% of what I was saving – maybe less. Because I had storage in abundance, it was easy not to be picky with what I was saving, and just keep everything.

The cost of storage isn’t money – it’s cognitive overload. I have hundreds of thousands of files. I saved things because I could save them, without any thought about whether I’d ever look at them again. Some of them I care about, but most of them I don’t! The collection is poorly organised, so it’s hard to find the stuff I actually care about.

Here are examples of collections where I saved stuff for the sake of saving it, without thinking about whether I should save it:

* I used to keep every photo I ever took, even though a lot of them were blurry, duplicates, or reminders of long-ago completed tasks. Whenever I looked through my photo library, I’d have to scroll past lots of bad photos to find the good ones.
* I’ve been through phases where I bookmarked every article I read, with no thought about whether I’d ever want to read it again. Often I didn’t write any context, so I just have a link and no memory of if or why it’s significant. Or the article is about a very specific thing and I’d be unlikely to read it again – like speculation about the Brexit vote, or workflows for a specific version of Docker.
* I saved every podcast episode I ever listened to, because it was easy and I could. Overcast can export an OPML file of every episode you’ve downloaded, and I wrote a script to download them all. There are some timeless podcast episodes I want to listen to again and again, but a lot of them are current affairs or news-related and I’m unlikely to listen to them again.

This is hoarding, plain and simple. Archivists and collectors know a good collection isn’t “anything goes” – it’s a considered selection of material that follows a particular theme, and might be interesting to look at later.

I listened to a great podcast recently [link], and the guest talked about how hoarding of physical clutter always has its roots in trauma. When it comes to my digital hoarding, “trauma” might be a strong word, but I can see parallels – I remember when I first went to read a fic and discovered the site had vanished, and I couldn’t find a copy anywhere else.

This approach of “keep everything” is unhelpful. I’ve accumulated a big pile of data. Some of it is stuff I definitely want to look at again, but most of it is stuff I never need to see again.

As I save new material, I’,m trying to be more intentional about what I keep. Before I save something, I ask myself: *“when will you want to look at this again?* If I can’t imagine a scenario in which I’d want to look at it again, I don’t save it.

That’s slowing the influx of new data, but there’s still the backlog of all the data I’ve collected over twenty years. I’ve been gradually pruning it, and building better tools to organise it. It’s slow going, because there’s no easy way to automate this – ultimately, I have to look at every item and decide if it’s worth keeping.

have been gradually pruning material + building better tools to organise
it's slow going, because there is no automating this – have to look at every item and decide if it's worth keeping
can built tools to help me, but eventually I have to look at things
(will write more about organisation in another post)

easy thing to hyperfocus on, so have to limit self
have already reviewed photos, videos, and podcasts
slowly doing bookmarks
i'm sure I have more folders of long-forgotten digital clutter I could clear out

trying to be more intentional about what I keep, new stuff
simple rule: "when will I want to look at this again"
gradually applying to old stuff and culling stuff that doesn't meet rule
long-held wisdom that "storage gets bigger over time"
trying to resist that

those 4TB hard drives are approaching end-of-life
had them for four years, want to get rid of before they break
will probably go to SSD, get rid of whirring mechanical sounds (and less risk of breaking)
but for first time, might go smaller

# part 2: organising my digital archives

trying to be more intentional about what I keep, new stuff
simple rule: "when will I want to look at this again"

follow-up question: "how will i find it when I want to?"
don't want to be creating stuff thrown into a void never to be seen again
want some way to add metadata to items I'm saving, so I can find them again
don't want to be onerous task

Different models for each type of thing
* e.g. photo needs very different metadata to fanfiction, or screenshot
* models are lightweight, only a handful of fields to fill in
	* e.g. video = title, source URL, description, tags, duration, path to downloaded file, date saved
* deliberately generic, not tied to particular service

two consistent themes: year and tag

one consistent theme: I love keyword tags
* not hierarchical folders, require single point of entry
* tags allow multiple points of entry
* e.g. if I save a music video I like, am I going to search for "music" or the genre or the artist's name?
* tagging: don't have to choice, apply to all
* theoretically can even combine tags for more filtered queries -- in practice rare, with smaller collections (few thousand items) a single tag gets me close enough

key is that I can tag quickly
* never wondering how I should tag something; if I have to think about it I'll get indecision and it gets thrown in the great bucket of "uncategorised" never to be seen again
* tags are v flexible, add as and when
* don't always tag consistently
* more folksonomy than taxonomy
* taxonomy would take a long time to create! is hard! requires library skills! big arguments!
* only person who has to understand these is me!
* and gradually refine over time
* (e.g. with fuzzy matching to find similar tags)

tags are v flexible, allow namespacing
* e.g. in my bookmarks I have `type:fic` `type:opinion` `type:howto` which create a layer of faceting within tags
* could be a separate `type` field but can shoehorn into tags + more flexible to add new categories as and when

then to retrieve? throw shuffle in the mix

lightweight data model, few fields, tags
* have used this approach across a variety of projects
* been pretty successful

# part 3: tools for my digital archives

have built these archives over 15 years
* would like them to remain usable for at least as long, ideally longer – rest of my life
* but don't want to be constantly maintaining and tinkering -- better things to do with my time
* have been thinking about how to design system that lasts

preserving software is always a challenge
* need to maintain working environment
* that's hard! world is changing
* operating systems change, language versions go out of date, dependencies break
* yuck

need something static, unchanging
* no environment required
* nothing to break

this is why plain text is so popular for taking notes
* text file or Markdown
* open file format, will remain readable
* not tied to any software package or environment
* highly likely to remain readable

I already use plain text for a lot of stuff!
* e.g. journal entries and reference notes
* v good for linear text
* less good for multimedia or interactivity, e.g. a list of videos

hmm… how to do plain text with interactivity?
* what about static websites?
* this is tech that has been v stable in my life
* not tied to any software package or environment
* highly likely to remain readable
* could open web pages on my 2003 iMac and still look broadly the same on my 2022 MacBook Air

have been gradually building static sites as front-end to my archives
* metadata in machine-readable JavaScript
* low-tech viewer, HTML CSS and vanilla JS
* allows presenting archive in more visual way, with a light sprinkling of interactivity for e.g. tag filters
* opens in web browser on any device, so highly likely to remain readable
* requires minimal tinkering
* and easy to "hack" if I want new features later

not a new idea
* e.g. instagram or twitter archives
* but those are big sprawling web apps!
* 18MB of JavaScript
* I build much simpler, smaller, by hand
* few hundred lines of code at most, keep it simple

this technique has worked well
* now have handful of tiny static websites that provide views into different archives
* e.g. different site for videos and podcasts
* static sites don't scale forever, but that's okay, not looking for big scale solution
* few thousand items at most

> I may or may not be working on some personal projects this year that I intend on using for myself. One thing I _know_ I can't do for my personal projects is constantly dedicate time to working on it after I've "shipped". I want to build something once, and ideally use it for the rest of my life (or maybe 20-50 years to start off) without having to worry about having to update something or other or risk losing something important down the line. So thinking about what properties makes software age well is helpful for me in terms of deciding what fundamental technologies (e.g. SQL or REST) I want to incorporate into a system design, and perhaps as equally important, what things I'm willing to trade away.

> Your outline for part 3 looks good and follows logically from the previous two parts. It focuses on the tools and technical approach you've developed for maintaining your digital archives over the long term. Here's a summary of the structure I see:
>
> 1. Introduction: Long-term preservation goals
>     - Desire for longevity (15+ years)
>     - Balancing maintenance with practicality
> 2. Challenges of software preservation
>     - Difficulties with maintaining working environments
>     - Issues with changing technologies
> 3. The appeal of static, unchanging solutions
>     - Benefits of environment-independent approaches
> 4. Plain text as a solution
>     - Advantages for linear text content
>     - Limitations for multimedia and interactivity
> 5. Static websites as a more versatile solution
>     - Stability and longevity of web technologies
>     - Compatibility across different devices and time periods
> 6. Implementation of static sites for archives
>     - Use of machine-readable JavaScript for metadata
>     - Simple HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS for viewing
>     - Benefits of this approach (visual presentation, interactivity, readability, minimal maintenance)
> 7. Comparison to existing solutions
>     - Contrast with large-scale archives (e.g., Instagram, Twitter)
>     - Emphasis on simplicity and hand-crafted approach
> 8. Results and current state
>     - Multiple small static websites for different archive types
>     - Scalability considerations
>
> This structure effectively builds upon the ideas introduced in parts 1 and 2, moving from the problem of digital clutter and organization to the technical implementation of a long-term archival solution. It provides a clear progression of ideas and practical insights into your archival system.

> Some thoughts on the structure:
>
> 1. The flow is logical, moving from the challenges of long-term preservation to your specific solution.
> 2. You've effectively explained the rationale behind your choices, particularly the move from plain text to static websites.

> 4. The structure allows for easy expansion of each point if needed.

## part 4: specific HTML techniques

metadata in JavaScript file
* example of lightweight JS file
* why JS? so can load in browser from `file://` URI, can't do with JSON/XML
* have python library to manipulate

use relative paths, be explicit
* don't push logic for constructing files for paths to elsewhere, just put the path in the file

HTML page example
* script tag to load JavaScript, then window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded") to render as elements on page
* simple example, see viewer loading metadata from machine-readable file

React-like components to render page
* example of `const Tweet = (props) => ```
* use JavaScript template literals
* not full React, data is immutable, doesn't react to state changes
* but simple!

URL query parameters for filtering
* forces page reload, re-render of data
* that's fine
* example of how to get URL query params in modern JS

can write by hand or build simple scripts to modify metadata
* should be simple enough to write and edit by hand
* virtues of plain text!
* but scripts can be helpful for getting the fiddly bits right

verify script
* does every file pointed to by the metadata exist?
* does the metadata point to every file stored locally?
* enforce other rules, e.g. on HTML page linking to filename with `?` is problem

store metadata in git
* track changes to viewer and metadata
* not pushed anywhere
* local backup, easy way to see changes if making batch changes
