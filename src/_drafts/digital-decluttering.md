**I’ve accumulated a lot of data, and most of it is clutter. I’ve been taking steps to store less data, organise it better, and make it easier to find the things I care about.**

I spent a lot of my formative Internet years in online fandom.
I read novel-length stories about *Doctor Who* characters.
I swooned over fan art of the *Lizzie Bennet Diaries*.
I pored over in-depth analyses of each episode of *Carmilla*.
I was surrounded by the creativity of strangers, sharing my own ideas, and taking the first steps towards my queer awakening.

Most of that is gone now.

Links rot at an extraordinary rate, and much of that early-2010s fan culture has now vanished from the Internet.
Accounts get deleted, websites go down, domain names lapse.
We might think the Internet [is written in ink][ink], but really it's more like chalk on a pavement.
Stuff is visible for a while, and over time it washes away.

Every fan eventually realises that if there's something they love, they have to save your own copy.
We all learnt this lesson the hard way, when we went to find something we remembered from years ago, and it had vanished from the face of the Internet.

So I started saving, and I kept saving.
Digital storage has become cheap and abundant, and I could afford to keep local copies of everything.
I didn't have to be picky with what I was saving.

I saved web pages and photos and PDFs and videos and audio files, and I wrote scripts to save as much as possible, all so I'd never lose anything again.
I kept every photo I'd ever taken, every tweet I'd written, every link I'd read.
If you look at early posts on this site or my old GitHub repos, you'll see my excitement at code that could scrape down data and squirrel it away on my hard drive.
I always thought "what if I want to go back to this someday?"

Looking back, I could skip 95% of this data and I'd be fine.
There are some things that I'm glad I saved, but there's an awful lot of other stuff that I've never gone back to, and I know I'm never going to look at again.
And because I was more interested in saving lots of files than organising what I had, it's difficult to find that 5% I actually care about.

I'm trying to simplify.
My data is currently split across my internal disk and several external hard drives, and those external drives need to be replaced soon.
Ideally I'd like to shrink my data until it fits on a single, internal disk.

As I save new stuff today, I'm trying to be more intentional about what I keep.
Before I save something, I ask myself "when will you want to look at this again?"
If I can't imagine a scenario in which I'd be glad to have saved this particular thing, I don't save it.
I've been collecting for fifteen years, and I know what sort of stuff I go back to.
Heartfelt stories and in-depth essays? Yes.
Current affairs and political news? Not so much.

That's slowing the influx of new data, but there's still the data I've already collected.
I've been gradually pruning it, deleting what I don't want and organising what I do.
It's a slow and arduous process, because there's no easy way to automate this -- ultimately, I have to look at every item and decide if it's worth keeping.

It took me years to accumulate this data, so I'm not going to clear it in a week.
I've already spent months chipping away at it, reviewing a few items a day, and there's plenty more to go.
So far I've reviewed all the photos I've taken, the videos I saved, the podcasts I kept.
I'm midway through cleaning up my bookmarks folder, and after that are my tweets.
I've shed thousands of files and tossed an entire hard drive, but more importantly, I can now find the items I actually care about.

Many nerds treat it as inevitable that our data gets bigger over time; that we'll always need more storage than we did in the past.
I don't think that's for certain, and I'm not sure it's sustainable -- we need to be more intentional about our data.
Modern storage means we can keep everything, but that doesn't mean we should.
"As much as I can save" isn't a collecting strategy; it's hoarding.

## Deciding what to keep

Everybody will have different criteria for what they think is worth keeping.
I haven't written a definitive set of rules, and I'm going more on instinct and intuition.
I'm only keeping my digital files for my personal use, so I'm the only person who needs to be happy with what I pick.

As well as asking myself *“when will you want to look at this again?”*, I've spotted a couple of other questions which have been useful to ask.
Thinking about these questions helps me decide whether something is worth keeping.

-   *Do I remember what this is?*
    If I don't, I'm not going to look for it again or be sad that it's gone.
    These are easy to deletion, and are probably the majority of what I'm pruning -- stuff I saved but have since forgotten.

    For example, as I was going through my photo library, I found lots of photos of places and buildings that I don't remember.
    What is this blurry grey cuboid?
    I have no idea what's in the photo, where it was taken, or why I thought it was important.

-   *Did I keep any notes about it?*
    I have some files where I wrote detailed notes and explanation of why I thought it was important.
    There are others where I didn't write anything.
    I usually want to keep the former, less so the latter.

    For example, I started with about 6000 bookmarks.
    Maybe half of those I'd written a short summary or other notes to remind me what the link was about; the other half I'd just saved a URL and title.
    Most of the latter were links I was saving in a hurry, saving for the sake of saving rather than because I'd want to find them again.
    I've deleted a lot of them.

-   *Is this timeless or time-limited?*
    If something is very tied to current affairs or the news, I'm unlikely to want it for the long-term.
    It might be useful for a historian, but that's not me.

    For instance, I listen to a lot of podcasts.
    Some of them are discussing recent news, like politics are the latest tech announcements -- I listen once and never again.
    I deleted a lot of podcast episodes speculating about the Brexit vote and the Python 2 transition.
    Others have more evergreen content, like fiction podcasts or lifestyle advice.
    I listen to some episodes multiple times, and I want local copies of my favourites.

-   *If I wanted to find this again, would I look in my personal archives?*

    One reason I save stuff is that I'm not sure I could find it again later -- even if the site is still online, it may not be findable unless you have the exact URL.
    This is particularly true for some fan communities, which deliberately don't make themselves too easy to find.

    As I've gone through my bookmarks, I've found a lot of basic reference material I saved when I started programming.
    I'd completely forgotten I had any of these links, and they don't contain any unique information -- for example, there are dozens of articles about how to save a file in Python.
    If I wanted to find that information again, I wouldn't look in my personal archives, I'd ask Google.

## Organising my digital archive

As I go through my data and choose what I want to keep, I'm gradually sorting it into a few different piles.

---

I'm gradually building a couple of different collections, each for a different type of thing.
I have

For over a year, I've been tidying up my data.
Every day I look at a handful of items, and I decide if I want to keep them.
If I don't, I delete them and move on.
If I do, I add some metadata that will help me remember why I thought it was worth keeping, and make it easier to find again in future.
I also move it into a new, simpler organisational structure.

It's a semi-manual process.
I've written some scripts and tools to help me find stuff I haven't reviewed yet, but ultimately I' have to look at each item and make a "yes/no" decision.


If it’s a treasured gift, keep it;
If it’s unread and bought less than three months ago, keep it;
If it’s a favourite you re-read often, keep it;
Everything else, send to the charity shop;
On March 1st every year, repeat the process.

# part 2: organising my digital archives

trying to be more intentional about what I keep, new stuff
simple rule: "when will I want to look at this again"

follow-up question: "how will i find it when I want to?"
don't want to be creating stuff thrown into a void never to be seen again
want some way to add metadata to items I'm saving, so I can find them again
don't want to be onerous task

Different models for each type of thing
* e.g. photo needs very different metadata to fanfiction, or screenshot
* models are lightweight, only a handful of fields to fill in
	* e.g. video = title, source URL, description, tags, duration, path to downloaded file, date saved
* deliberately generic, not tied to particular service

two consistent themes: year and tag

one consistent theme: I love keyword tags
* not hierarchical folders, require single point of entry
* tags allow multiple points of entry
* e.g. if I save a music video I like, am I going to search for "music" or the genre or the artist's name?
* tagging: don't have to choice, apply to all
* theoretically can even combine tags for more filtered queries -- in practice rare, with smaller collections (few thousand items) a single tag gets me close enough

key is that I can tag quickly
* never wondering how I should tag something; if I have to think about it I'll get indecision and it gets thrown in the great bucket of "uncategorised" never to be seen again
* tags are v flexible, add as and when
* don't always tag consistently
* more folksonomy than taxonomy
* taxonomy would take a long time to create! is hard! requires library skills! big arguments!
* only person who has to understand these is me!
* and gradually refine over time
* (e.g. with fuzzy matching to find similar tags)

tags are v flexible, allow namespacing
* e.g. in my bookmarks I have `type:fic` `type:opinion` `type:howto` which create a layer of faceting within tags
* could be a separate `type` field but can shoehorn into tags + more flexible to add new categories as and when

then to retrieve? throw shuffle in the mix

lightweight data model, few fields, tags
* have used this approach across a variety of projects
* been pretty successful

# part 3: tools for my digital archives

[[sucked down data, lots of machine-readable files but no human-readable interface]]

have built these archives over 15 years
* would like them to remain usable for at least as long, ideally longer – rest of my life
* but don't want to be constantly maintaining and tinkering -- better things to do with my time
* have been thinking about how to design system that lasts

preserving software is always a challenge
* need to maintain working environment
* that's hard! world is changing
* operating systems change, language versions go out of date, dependencies break
* yuck

need something static, unchanging
* no environment required
* nothing to break

this is why plain text is so popular for taking notes
* text file or Markdown
* open file format, will remain readable
* not tied to any software package or environment
* highly likely to remain readable

I already use plain text for a lot of stuff!
* e.g. journal entries and reference notes
* v good for linear text
* less good for multimedia or interactivity, e.g. a list of videos

hmm… how to do plain text with interactivity?
* what about static websites?
* this is tech that has been v stable in my life
* not tied to any software package or environment
* highly likely to remain readable
* could open web pages on my 2003 iMac and still look broadly the same on my 2022 MacBook Air

have been gradually building static sites as front-end to my archives
* metadata in machine-readable JavaScript
* low-tech viewer, HTML CSS and vanilla JS
* allows presenting archive in more visual way, with a light sprinkling of interactivity for e.g. tag filters
* opens in web browser on any device, so highly likely to remain readable
* requires minimal tinkering
* and easy to "hack" if I want new features later

not a new idea
* e.g. instagram or twitter archives
* but those are big sprawling web apps!
* 18MB of JavaScript
* I build much simpler, smaller, by hand
* few hundred lines of code at most, keep it simple

this technique has worked well
* now have handful of tiny static websites that provide views into different archives
* e.g. different site for videos and podcasts
* static sites don't scale forever, but that's okay, not looking for big scale solution
* few thousand items at most

> I may or may not be working on some personal projects this year that I intend on using for myself. One thing I _know_ I can't do for my personal projects is constantly dedicate time to working on it after I've "shipped". I want to build something once, and ideally use it for the rest of my life (or maybe 20-50 years to start off) without having to worry about having to update something or other or risk losing something important down the line. So thinking about what properties makes software age well is helpful for me in terms of deciding what fundamental technologies (e.g. SQL or REST) I want to incorporate into a system design, and perhaps as equally important, what things I'm willing to trade away.

> Your outline for part 3 looks good and follows logically from the previous two parts. It focuses on the tools and technical approach you've developed for maintaining your digital archives over the long term. Here's a summary of the structure I see:

> 1. Introduction: Long-term preservation goals
>     - Desire for longevity (15+ years)
>     - Balancing maintenance with practicality
> 2. Challenges of software preservation
>     - Difficulties with maintaining working environments
>     - Issues with changing technologies
> 3. The appeal of static, unchanging solutions
>     - Benefits of environment-independent approaches
> 4. Plain text as a solution
>     - Advantages for linear text content
>     - Limitations for multimedia and interactivity
> 5. Static websites as a more versatile solution
>     - Stability and longevity of web technologies
>     - Compatibility across different devices and time periods
> 6. Implementation of static sites for archives
>     - Use of machine-readable JavaScript for metadata
>     - Simple HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS for viewing

## part 4: specific HTML techniques

metadata in JavaScript file
* example of lightweight JS file
* why JS? so can load in browser from `file://` URI, can't do with JSON/XML
* have python library to manipulate

use relative paths, be explicit
* don't push logic for constructing files for paths to elsewhere, just put the path in the file

HTML page example
* script tag to load JavaScript, then window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded") to render as elements on page
* simple example, see viewer loading metadata from machine-readable file

React-like components to render page
* example of `const Tweet = (props) => ```
* use JavaScript template literals
* not full React, data is immutable, doesn't react to state changes
* but simple!

URL query parameters for filtering
* forces page reload, re-render of data
* that's fine
* example of how to get URL query params in modern JS

can write by hand or build simple scripts to modify metadata
* should be simple enough to write and edit by hand
* virtues of plain text!
* but scripts can be helpful for getting the fiddly bits right

verify script
* does every file pointed to by the metadata exist?
* does the metadata point to every file stored locally?
* enforce other rules, e.g. on HTML page linking to filename with `?` is problem

store metadata in git
* track changes to viewer and metadata
* not pushed anywhere
* local backup, easy way to see changes if making batch changes
