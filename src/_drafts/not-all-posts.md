For a while now, this website has been my own personal writer's block.
I was struggling to write, even when I had good ideas; if I wrote something I liked, I was often reluctant to publish; if somebody asked to read the site, I'd wince before giving them the link.
Something was wrong, but I couldn't put my finger on it.

At the start of this year, I finally had a breakthrough: I split my writing into two distinct categories.
"Articles" and "Today I Learned" are more than just headings -- they became permission to write differently.
I no longer takes a "one size fits all" approach to my writing, and instead I let different posts have different strengths.
It's made my writing better, and I'm doing more of it.
(I've published as many posts in 2024 as in the prior three years *combined*.)

This is accompanied by a bit of a visual refresh, which lets me showcase my personal favourites among the things I've written.

I waited to write about this, because I wanted to be sure these changes weren't just a temporary fix.
Now the year is over, I can call it a success.
Let's go through what changed.

## What do I write?

After twelve years of writing this site, I've noticed something interesting: my posts fall pretty naturally into two categories.
This wasn't a deliberate choice -- it's just emerged from the things I wanted to write.

**The first category is the problem-solvers.**
These are usually about programming, written when I figure something out and want to remember it for later.
They're notes to my future self, and I publish them online so other people can find them.
I've read a lot of these notes written by other people, and publishing my own is a way of "giving back".
If you're struggling with the same problem, these posts are golden -- and if not, you'll scroll right past.

These posts are easy to write -- they have a clear purpose and a captive audience.
If I give them a specific title, they're easy to find, and they get a lot of traffic from search engines.

**The second category is the reflections.**
These posts aren't about solving technical problems -- they're about exploring ideas and sharing experiences.
When I write about [Digital decluttering], [Mountaintop moments], or [Hyperfocus and hobbies], I'm trying to capture something more universal, something that isn't just for programmers.

This is some of my favourite writing, and it's where I think new readers should start.
They're much harder to write, because I don't have the easy hook of "here's your solution to keep you reading" -- but I think the extra time and effort is reflected in the quality of the final piece.

These articles aren't as popular, but I'm more proud of them.
Nobody has ever had an emotional breakthrough reading about command line arguments or Python function minutiae, but when I write about gender, or mental health, or the human experience?
Those are the posts that resonate.

## What was I doing wrong?

My big mistake was trying to pretend this distinction didn't exist.
This manifested in a couple of ways.

**I tried to cram an unnecessary reflection into every problem-solving post.**
I would try to find some nugget of wisdom, some universal idea that would benefit a reader who didn't have the same problem as me.
Was this useful for anyone?

If you do have the problem, you'll probably skip my broad generalisations and commentary.
It's a big like online recipes that start with eight paragraphs of backstory.
If you don't have the problem, how likely are you to read a post that promises to solve that exact problem?

Trying to find the reflection would slow me down, and many posts never got past drafts because I couldn't think of a good angle.
I wasted a lot of useful writing because I couldn't appeal to the imaginary reader who wanted to read reflections in my problem-solving posts.

**I rushed my reflections, and compromised on quality.**
I can write problem-solving posts pretty quickly, but it takes longer to write reflections.
They need more editing and drafting, because they're more complex pieces, and because I have less experience with that style of writing.

I'd berate myself for being so slow to write reflections, and publish them before they were ready.
*"You finished that post in an hour, so why are you taking so long on this one?"*
The pressure to publish quickly was entirely self-imposed.
I have no external deadlines or commitments, but I felt like I was taking too long and wanted to get them done.

There are reflections that I know I could have made better, if only I'd given myself more time.

**If I published a good reflection, I was reluctant to post anything else.**
Like many blogs, I had a list of recent posts on my homepage, and the last post I published would get top billing.
It was the most prominent piece of writing for anybody arriving at the site.

After I published a reflection I was proud of, I was excited to see it in that prominent position -- and then I'd be reluctant to publish something else that would make it less visible.
This often meant that problem-solving posts would be delayed or cancelled, because I didn't want something with niche appeal to displace a reflection that could appeal to a wide audience.
Because chronology was the only way I organised posts, there was nothing to stop a specific solution overshadowing a general reflection.

This is completely backwards -- when I've written something good, I should be encouraged by the positive feedback to write something else!
Not sit on my hands and give up on writing or a week.

**New readers would often see nothing but the problem-solving posts.**
I can't count how many times a friend has heard I have a website, got excited, and told me later "oh it all seemed too technical for me".
They looked at the homepage when my recent posts were all problem-solving, thought I only wrote about programming, and bounced off.

I always find this disappointing, and it's why I used to wince before giving somebody the link.
I know I've written stuff they'd find interesting, but the design of the site makes it too difficult for them to find it -- and worse than that, it leaves them the bitter taste of "not being smart enough" to understand what I've written.

I want this site to be something that I'm proud to share, not something that feels vaguely embarrassing.

I wanted every post to contain some nugget of wisdom, some universal truth that would benefit everybody who read it

Mistake in past has been trying to conflate the two, in particular trying to give specific solutions appeal to broad audience
* If you have same problem, you don't care about broad generalisations and commentary
* Like finding a recipe which starts with eight paragraphs of backstory
	* Sometimes you want the backstory
	* Sometimes you don't
* If you don't have problem, how likely are you to read?

I have a pretty good sense

## Start by simply scrolling

I created this site in 2012 using a static site framework called Octopress
chronological ordering
homepage dropped you on my latest article, go backwards by scrolling through
if you wanted to go back further, had to paginate

[[screenshot]]

alexwlchan.net.2013-09-22.png / forgot i had "read more" buttons in default octopress theme, which made this more usable

alexwlchan.net.2016-04-19.png

https://web.archive.org/web/20130821221620/http://www.alexwlchan.net/

you'd see whatever the last thing i wrote was, whether or not it was the best thing I'd written

not an issue
i was mostly writing for practice and didn't have much of an audience
a lot of programming, tied to specific tools or frameworks
i was already using specific titles, which are great for search, but no stuff in my archive

(also good for SEO imo -- gets people to click)

## Look! A list of links

default octopress also came with archives page, list of links
archives essentially invisible to humans
feels more like a book

Screenshot 2024-12-19 at 23.16.03

As I kept writing, started to get articles I'd want to refer back to
Hard to do in infinite scrolling!
I added a proper landing page and a list of links
Still very chronologically focused, e.g. had per-year and per-month headings

[[screenshot]]

Entire index fits on one page!
I really like this -- imo anything on "page 2" might as well not exist
So much less likely to be seen

And relying on specific titles to help you know what to read
Weirdly this made the programming posts more prominent
Because titles easieer to understand in a list; broad posts get lost

recent posts were list on homepage

julia evans has an excellent site with a similar "list of links"
and added a star to denote her favorites
I have a distinct memory of her tweeting about thsi change, but I can't find it now (mayeb I imagine it? mandela effect)

[[screenshot]]

Screenshot 2024-12-19 at 23.17.07

I copied her topic-based nav with a pixel heart
but didn't last long -- non-obvious what it was, not prominent enough
julia's been doing for eight years

cargo culting
useful lesson: don't copy ideas without understanding underlying reasoning

## Cargo culting cards

the next thing i did was copy ideas without understanding underlying reasoning

around 2020 i started working on wellcome collection stories site
light front-end stuff

that site does a lot more long-form, timeless writing
and articles are accompanied by gorgeous imagery
that's cool!
what if I did that

replaced my list of links with article cards
each with picture, description and date

[[screenshot]]

Screenshot 2024-12-19 at 23.17.40

recent posts were card on homepage

Screenshot 2024-12-19 at 23.17.58

writing description was good!
first bit of pseudo-marketing -- trying to persuade people they might want to read something, not just letting them passively land on page

fun with css flex
one of the most complex web layouts to date
(i build simple web pages)

definitely felt fun for a while!

## to heck with homogeneity

was a good shot in the arm and i enjoyed picking out pictures and colours
but problems with this approach:

1. finding card images was a stretch sometimes
  -> does it help anyone if i put a stock image of a fish on fish shell?

2. disincentivised to write
  -> good articles get prominent billing on homepage
  -> posting something more niche makes it less prominent

the cards felt novel and special at first but shine faded
if everything is special, nothing is

um

the thing that finally prompted the solution was the sheer size of the articles page
although images are lazy loaded, just the HTML markup was nearly half a megabyte
oof
and i don't want to paginate

how do i make it smaller?
do i need all these card images?

then it hit me: different types of post should have a different visual appearance
cards for good articles, list of links for rest

hybrid approach

Screenshot 2024-12-19 at 23.18.40

[[screenshot]]

the cards really draw your attention because they're the first thing you should look at
then the list of links, if you already know you're looking for something specific

organised by date-ish, thumbing scales for cards
cards will always be organised in nice-looking groups
and cards will always be first

meanwhile homepage loses list of recent posts, and just a random selection of favourites
this is a componet called "eggbox" stolen from stories
shows a random selection on each page load, 6 of 43
so they're the first thing a new reader see, hope you'll see something you like

in hindsight this is _so obvious_
anybody who's done design knows you use contrast to draw the reader's attention
big or prominent elements are important, small or hidden elements less so
example i thought of as i designed this was newspapers: headline story gets a big space on the page, small local news is much smaller

wellcome collection stories doesn't do my niche, specific stuff so all cards is appropriate for them
i wanted to write more stuff like that but i didn't want to write just that

## today i learned

and created a new site section "today i learned" for quick posts which are published with minimal editing
get some of the most specific, niche google fodder out of main feed

"if you open more than 10 pages in google"

lowers bar to posting even further
as long as it contains some useful info then worth posting!
seeding future google results

## down with dates, turn to tags

one other change i made was removing all the dates from article list

organising everything by date is holdover from default blog structure
how blogs have been organised for years
good for journals and news but that's not what I write!
nobody is looking for "what alex wrote in 2021"

(for more on this read amy hoy)

i am primary user of this blog, and I know I almost never look by date on other personal blogs
i do look at topics!
like to go to somebody's list of topics, and ctrl-click to open a bunch of topics in tabs

[[screenshot]]

Screenshot 2024-12-19 at 23.19.54

so removed dates from primary nav, and replaced with list of tags/topics
anecdotally, this is what i use now!
previosuly would find article by going to article index, ⌘+F in page to find title, now use tags

dates still on individual pages -- useful to know if programming post is outdated

this is the first iteration of tag page and might refine later -- for example, no way to see popular vs niche tags
maybe a tag cloud? but harder to read

in meantime, list of popular tags on homepage

[[screenshot]]

Screenshot 2024-12-19 at 23.19.35

this is all part of broader push to help people find good stuff

## So, how's it going?

honestly really happy
articles page looks great, no longer feel disincentive to post
(haven't posted much in last month or so because working on another big project, but oh well)
and feel breathing room to edit and write long articles properly

love the new topic-based navigation which I use a lot
(and have discovered stuff i forgot i wrote in there)

love the today i learned
am writing a lot of stuff that would otherwise have been lost

one thing that's surprising is how much a few design choices were suppressing my writing
i have so much to say!
but was being disincentivised from doing it
where else is that happening?

have been withdrawing from social media and touching AI tentatively
feels fun to have a place on the internet that's just mine, where i can experiment with design and appearance and do whatever i want

this feels like the promise of the web -- an infinite canvas where we can build wherever we want
fun to be breaking a few of the cultural conventions around what a blog is

have one or two more things banked for 2024 and then want to double down in 2025
goal is to write, not to build space for writing
see you in 2025!
