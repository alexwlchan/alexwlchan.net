This question came up at work today, and I was rather pleased with my answer, so I'm reproducing it here.

It starts by respecting the non-engineers as equals.
Some software engineers have a superiority complex and treat everyone else like dunderheads, which is a terrible foundation for a good working relationship.
Respect the competency and expertise of your peers, especially when it's in a different field.

(A sidebar: I dislike the term "non-technical" when it's used as synonymous with "doesn't write code" or similar. People can be skilled – that is to say, technical – in their own fields, which have nothing to do with software.)

Then talk to people in their own terms.
Don't try to overwhelm them with technical jargon or unnecessary detail.
When you need to explain something, explain it in a way they'll understand.

For example, when I'm talking about Amazon S3, I might call it a "highly-available, distributed cloud object store" when talking to another engineer, but a "place to put files" when talking to a librarian.
The second explanation is in terms they'll understand, without dumbing it down.
(Remember: respect their competence and expertise.
They're not stupid, they just need a different level of detail.)

relate it back to thier business concerns

As part of those explanations, I try to relate the topic back to problems they care about.
What's the business goal they're trying to achieve?
How does the technology fit into that?
Because those goals are what the organisation actually cares about.
Those goals are what should be guiding our work.

Wellcome is a museum and library, not a software factory.
