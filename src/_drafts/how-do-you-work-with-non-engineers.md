I was asked this yesterday, and I was quite pleased with my answer, so I'm reproducing it here.

It starts by respecting non-engineers as equals.
Some software engineers have a superiority complex and treat everyone else like dunderheads, which is a terrible foundation for a working relationship.
Respect the competency and expertise of your peers, especially when it's in a different field.

I [dislike the term "non-technical"][non_technical] when it's used as synonymous with "doesn't write code" or something similar.
People can be technical – that is to say, skilled – in their own fields, which have nothing to do with software.

Then talk to people in their own terms.
Don't try to overwhelm them with technical jargon or unnecessary detail.
When you need to explain something, describe it in a way they'll understand and care about.

For example, when I'm talking about Amazon S3, I might call it a "highly-available, distributed cloud object store" when talking to another engineer, but a "place to put files" when talking to a librarian.
The second explanation is in terms they'll understand, without dumbing it down.
(Remember: respect their competence and expertise.
They're not unintelligent, they just need a different level of detail.)

And I try to relate technical topics back to problems they care about.
What's the business goal they're trying to achieve?
How does technology help to drive that goal forward?
Those goals are what the organisation actually cares about; they're what should be driving our work.

Wellcome is a museum and library, not a software factory.
Technology should be led by the organisation's needs, not the other way round.
