Over the last three weeks, I've been writing about how I manage my bookmarks.
I wrote about how I use a static site to store them, how I built a personal web archive by hand, and what I learnt about web development.
In the final post of this series, I want something a bit more light-hearted.
I want to show you some of my favorite web sites that I found in my bookmarks – people who do really fun or creative stuff with the web.

## The ever-changing "planets" of Kottke.org

Jason Kottke's website [kottke.org] has a sidebar which shows four circles.
Every visitor sees [a different set of circles][redesign], and there are nearly a trillion possible combinations.
