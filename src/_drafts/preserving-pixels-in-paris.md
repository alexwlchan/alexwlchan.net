Last month, I was in Paris for the [IIPC Web Archiving Conference][conf], a two-day event to discuss the preservation of websites and social media.
It was my first time attending, and I was there with both a [professional](https://www.flickr.org/) and a [personal](/articles/?tag=digital-preservation) interest.
This post has some thoughts and photos from the trip.

I met a lot of smart people, and we had some thoughtful conversations about the challenges of web archiving.
Most of my experience is limited to small scale projects -- single sites or personal archives -- and it was good to hear more about how larger organisations are trying to preserve this ever-growing chunk of our digital heritage.
I tend to save specific, targeted chunks of the web, whereas larger archives take a more indiscriminate approach, just capturing as much as they can.

Big tech was a running theme.
An increasing chunk of the web is consolidating onto large, commercially-owned social media platforms.
A few years ago, those companies would have freely-available APIs for downloading content en masse, but no more -- but they're all locked now, and several speakers talked about how their ability to archive social media has been severely curtailed.

The other hot topic was AI.
As web archives grow and grow and grow, you need a way to search and summarise their contents.
Multiple people showed off experiments using AI to make these large archives more tractable, for example using AI to add more metadata to catalogue records.

A lot of the focus was on saving web content and creating large web archives, but less on what we'll actually do with these archives.
Who's using web archives?
What do they need?
What research do these web archives enable?
These feel like important questions to answer, if we want to create useful resources.
I'd love to see more of a focus on that at future events.

With those reflections done, here are a few photos.
Paris is a very photogenic city.

The conference took place at the [Bibliothèque nationale de France][bnf].
The drinks reception was at the [Richelieu Site][richelieu], which was the home of the library for nearly 300 years.
It includes a museum, which we got to look around before the reception:

Thinking about web archiving
Bunch of interesting conversations
Lot of focus on capturing stuff, less on what to do with it + how to find it
Bookmark archives – would never look through my web archive collection directly, instead use bookmark metadata as index

Photos of Paris!







BnF reception, gorgeous old building





Paris = clocks ahead = time for early morning walk
Local park:





Conference itself was held in modern building
Really cool







Including liminal space



Dinner up a tower, where we could look out over Paris
Final night, went for wander round Paris in evening


 






Cool fountain, metro stations in the dark, even passed some sort of music event
And of course can’t go to Paris without food, om nom croque monsieur






Until next time, Paris.
