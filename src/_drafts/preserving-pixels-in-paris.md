Last month, I was in Paris for the [IIPC Web Archiving Conference][conf], a two-day event to discuss the preservation of websites and social media.
It was my first time attending, and I was there with both a [professional](https://www.flickr.org/) and a [personal](/articles/?tag=digital-preservation) interest.
This post has some thoughts and photos from the trip.

I met a lot of smart people, and we had some thoughtful conversations about the challenges of web archiving.
Most of my experience is limited to small scale projects -- single sites or personal archives -- and it was good to hear more about how larger organisations are trying to preserve this ever-growing chunk of our digital heritage.
I tend to save specific, targeted chunks of the web, whereas larger archives take a more indiscriminate approach, just capturing as much as they can.

Big tech was a running theme.
An increasing chunk of the web is consolidating onto large, commercially-owned social media platforms.
A few years ago, those companies would have freely-available APIs for downloading content en masse, but no more -- but they're all locked now, and several speakers talked about how their ability to archive social media has been severely curtailed.

The other hot topic was AI.
As web archives grow and grow and grow, you need a way to search and summarise their contents.
Multiple people showed off experiments using AI to make these large archives more tractable, for example using AI to add more metadata to catalogue records.

A lot of the focus was on saving web content and creating large web archives, but less on what we'll actually do with these archives.
Who's using web archives?
What do they need?
What research do these web archives enable?
These feel like important questions to answer, if we want to create useful resources.
I'd love to see more of a focus on that at future events.

With those reflections done, here are a few photos.
Paris is a very photogenic city.

The conference took place at the [Bibliothèque nationale de France][bnf], which is split across two sites.
The drinks reception was at the [Richelieu Site][richelieu], which was the home of the library for nearly 300 years.
It includes a museum, which we got to look around before the reception:

    This is the <a href="https://www.bnf.fr/en/mazarin-gallery">Galerie Mazarin</a>, named after the seventeenth-century <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_Mazarin">cardinal of the same name</a>.
    In the foreground is a celestial globe made by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincenzo_Coronelli">Vincenzo Coronelli</a>, an Italian cartographer well known for his maps and globes.
    There were several other maps in the gallery, although it wasn’t always obvious which area they were showing.

    This unusual geometric design is the work of the German artist Lorenz Stöer, one of a series of <a href="http://bibliodyssey.blogspot.com/2009/09/geometric-landscape.html">eleven illustrations</a> he published in <em>Geometria et Perspectiva</em> in 1567.

The reception itself took place in the Richelieu's [salle Oval], a grand reading space that blends a historical design with modern library conveniences.
When you think of big and impressive libraries, this is the sort of room you think of:

<figure>
  {%

    filename="oval-room-ceiling.jpg"
    width="750"
    alt="Looking up towards the ceiling. There's a large oval window at the very top of the ceiling, then smaller circular windows around it. Above each window is the name of a city; below it is an archway with bookshelves filling the archway. Each archway is wide, enough to hold six bookshelves."

  <figcaption>
    There are sixteen circular windows around the ceiling, and above each is the name of a city <a href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/html/und/histoire/la-salle-ovale">famous for its contributions to civilisation and libraries</a>.
    All the windows filled the room with natural light, so it felt warm and open, even though it was already evening when I took this photo.
    I bet it looks even better in the summer.

    Even in a room this photogenic, the speaker had little trouble getting everyone's attention.

One of the nice things about going to a conference in France is that their clocks are only an hour ahead of the UK -- close enough that I can stick to my normal sleep schedule, and I get some extra time in the morning to enjoy the spring weather.
Before the first day of talks started properly, I went for a bit of a wander.

The sun was shining, and I stumbled upon a lovely little park near the hotel:

Paris = clocks ahead = time for early morning walk
Local park:





Conference itself was held in modern building
Really cool







Including liminal space



Dinner up a tower, where we could look out over Paris
Final night, went for wander round Paris in evening









Cool fountain, metro stations in the dark, even passed some sort of music event
And of course can’t go to Paris without food, om nom croque monsieur






Until next time, Paris.
