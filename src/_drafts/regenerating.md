If you follow me on Twitter, you might have noticed I seem to care a lot about trans stuff – sharing articles about gender, writing about things that affect trans people, retweeting nice stories from trans friends, and so on.
And you might have asked yourself “hey, why does Alex care so much?”
Why is he such an enthusiastic cis ally?
(One person has literally asked me this.)

I’d been trying to ignore this question for a long time, because thinking about it seemed big and scary, but last year the stars aligned, and I decided to pull on that thread.
My maths teachers always told me to show my working, so here goes.

Experienced members of the trans community know exactly where this is going.
A lot of trans people start out as dedicated cis allies, but



common Q: how do you know what your gender is?
“you just know”

this is pretty unhelpful if you’re not sure
uncertainty is fine and normal

this is till a WIP, my maths teachers always told me to show my working, so here goes

I was born a boy, and for twenty-odd years, I didn’t have any strong feelings about my gender.
I had vague notions that it might be nice to be a girl when I was a teenager, but I always kept them to myself.
It felt like an aberrant thought; something to be ashamed of and to be repressed.

I didn’t have much exposure to trans people (except as the occasional punchline of jokes in sitcoms), and “transgender” wasn’t a word in my vocabulary.
I didn't wonder if I was trans because I didn't know being trans was a thing you could be.

After university, I started spending a lot more time in LGBTQ+ communities, and I started meeting people who were visibly trans.
I met a couple in person at [PyCon UK 2016](https://2016.pyconuk.org/), and through them I started meeting more trans people on Twitter -- it's a small and tight-knit community -- and now I consider many of them to be good friends.
I took an interest in the issues that affected them, I started learning about transition, the community in-jokes, and so on.

Alongside all this, I was becoming a lot more comfortable in my own skin.
As a teenager I'd never really liked my appearance, but now I was starting to take pictures of myself I didn't hate!
I was becoming less disgusted by my body, and I was developing a fashion sense I actually liked.
This is one of the ways my trans friends really rubbed off on me -- there's a strong vibe of body positivity in the trans community.

But deep down, I knew I still had these unresolved feelings about gender from since I was a teenager, and I pushed those down and tried not to think about them.
I knew, deep down, I was putting it off, but if I didn't think about it then I could ignore it, right?
It seems obvious in hindsight, but I was in deep denial.
If you think it looks obvious in retrospect, you’re probably right -- but don't beat yourself up about it, that's a very common feeling.

As I kept listening to my trans friends, I kept hearing parts of their story that resonated.
I learnt more about dysphoria, and how it isn't all or nothing.
(I'd largely become comfortable with my body, but facial hair in particular was still a massive source of discomfort.)
I started to acknowledge the things that had made me feel uncomfortable, like being lumped in with "the guys".
How the majority of my friends were women.
How I enjoyed spending time with trans friends.
How, secretly, there was a part of me that wished I looked as good and happy as my trans friends.
And so on.

Six months ago, I finally confided in a couple of close friends, who've helped talk me through those feelings.
They listened to me as I explained my confusion, and gently pointed to resources and other people who've had similar feelings (sometimes themselves!).
I've written a lot of journal entries, and spent a lot of time looking at those feelings directly.
I've also spent a lot of time talking about this in therapy.

I've spent a lot of time wondering if I'm a trans woman.
I've been experimenting with appearance -- makeup and clothing and wigs.
I've been experimenting with identifiers -- using "she/her" pronouns, and trying the name "Lexie", which is a feminine version of my name I've always liked.
I've been burning off the wretched facial hair with a laser.
I spent most of a recent conference ([ACCU 2019](https://conference.accu.org/)) in girlmode, and was surrounded by people who gave me the confidence and courage to do that.

Elements of that feel good, but "trans woman" doesn't quite feel right to me.
There are aspects of femininity I like, and I've been much more femme in the last six months.
I've had many feminine days, and those feel good, but there are other aspects that don't seem to fit.

I don't have much dysphoria about my maleness, or any real desire to deconstruct my male identity (at least, not right now).
A lot of the trans women I know talk about their old male identity with disgust, and hate the body they were born with.
They shed that identity years ago, and they aren't looking back.
I don't get that feeling.

One major component of many people's transition is hormone therapies

HANNAH BODY?

That doesn't feel right, although elements of it lien up?
Aspects of femininity I like, and been much more femme in six months
had many feminine days!
That feels good!
But other aspects don't match — eg no dysphoria about maleness, no desire to deconstruct male identity right now
a lot of trans women i know talk about their old male identity with disgust, and hate the body they were born with
i don’t get that?
Laser hair removal yay
Hormones NAY?
Lots of people very sure that assigned gender is wrong, other binary is right!
Not me

~

right now figuring
I'm some flavour of genderqueer (not nom binary, why do I dislike that label)

Overall very successful so far
Family have been kind, friends supportive, work colleagues have been nice
Definitely more to think about, but has been exhausting start of year and need to slow down for a bit
This is a good milestone

Practical effects: I'm a lot happier!
Getting eco experiment with this is good, makes me happy, makes em feel more like myself
Those are all good things
Otherwise very little changes

I'm keeping my name
I have nice feelings about Alex, and no desire to change
Tho trying a Lexie in private, expect to see that more
Pronouns haven't found set I like, vary between them
Gender neutral please?

~

So why am I talking about it?
Could retreat, be quiet about it, make it a private thing

When I wa staring to work out if I was trans, it was really helpful to see and read experiences of other trans people who were willing to be visible
so grateful for that, especially because i know it’s something that wasn’t available to any of them
I can afford to be visible,e so I am
This is my pebble

And I want to be able to talk about trans stuff!
Not subtle if you look at Twitter
 Y writing this post, can get a consumer to message

advice:

* educate yourself, know what’s out there. talk to other trans people! they’re friendly
* experiment. in private or in public, see how it feels. trying it once doesn’t mean you’re committing forever. you don’t have to know the destination – just pick bits that fit. “explore the territory, not the map”
* reflect, we suck at it. i find journalling helps (i’ve been writing posts like this and it really helps my thinking)
* get help. there’s a great community of trans people on twitter, in private forums, or if you’re lucky you know a few in person. i find therapy really helpful as well, if that’s practical

So hi, I'm Lexie,I'm genderfluid, and I feel fabulous.
