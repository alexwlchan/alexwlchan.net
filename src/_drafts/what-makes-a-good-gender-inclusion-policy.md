Policies vary for externals, e.g. grant holders

The policy is less important than the questions you ask to get there
Writing the policy is the important bit!@
No easy answers

At Wellcome, we have an LGBTQ+ staff network, which aims to support and celebrate our LGBTQ+ employees.
This year, the network is focusing on making the organisation more supportive and inclusive for trans people.
Lack of trans inclusion was one of the criticisms in last year's Stonewall [Workplace Equality Index], and some of us at Wellcome could be doing more to support our trans colleagues.

One aspect of that is having a gender inclusion policy, that affirms our commitment to supporting and respecting our trans staff.
Right now, Wellcome doesn't have any policies about this, and several people have expressed surprise that one doesn't exist yet!
Together with the dedicated [Diversity and Inclusion team], we're trying to fix that.

I know some trans people, and I thought they might have some ideas, so I put up this tweet a week ago:

I expected a handful of replies -- I was pleasantly surprised.

Dozens of people reached out with suggestions, pointing me to policies at their own companies or others, and giving me lots of material to read.
I'm incredibly grateful to everybody who sent me a message.
In this post, I'm going to go through some of the common themes I spotted.



reading a variety of orgs was v useful
e.g. public-facing roles


<!--
## Why have a policy at all?

A policy is a statement that defines an organisation's values.
It establishes a clear, consistent baseline for acceptable behaviour, with no grey areas.
It sets expectations for how you should be treated at work.

If you're part of a minority group that often comes in for harassment or abuse -- whether that's for gender, race, disability, or something else -- a policy tells you how you can expect to be treated.
You're not relying on the individual interpretations of your team or manager, which might be unclear or unfriendly.

If there's a trans person in your workplace who isn't out yet, a good policy means they know the organisation will look after them.
And if they do face harassment or abuse after coming out, they have a way to deal with it.

A policy is also a visible commitment to treating people with dignity and respect.



## Why write your own policy?

A policy is a statement of an organisation's values.
If you just copy somebody else's policy, it may not fit -- their values may be different to yours.

And every organisation is different.
You'll have scenarios to consider that aren't relevant in other organisations, and only you can decide what to do.



## How do you write a policy?

You can't just copy somebody else's policy -- their values may be different to yours, and the decisions won't fit.

A friend of mine, Gemma, says, "The policy is less important than the questions you ask to get there". -->




## How do you write a policy?

Writing a good policy is about asking questions.
What scenarios might somebody face?
How do we handle those as an organisation?
How do we respond?
Every organisation will have different scenarios, and different answers -- you can't just copy somebody else's work wholesale.

Most of the policies I read

But while specific scenarios may differ, there is a lot of overlap.
These are some of the common themes, listed as questions you'll need to answer:

*   What's the goal of the policy?

    I saw lots of overlap in the policies I

---

Every policy I read had pretty similar goals:

*   Provide appropriate support to trans employees
*   Guarantee privacy and confidentiality
*   Encourage a gender diverse working environment

---

* statement of high-level values
	* assume open and respectful discussion
	* acknowledge that trans is a multi-step process, different definitions – not necessarily medical intervention, not always possible, doesn’t invalidate; social/medical/legal transition
	* individual process
	* not just binary

* recognise that a policy is for different people
	* somebody who is trans or transitioning
	* people who work with them – managers, coworkers
	* external people – clients, customers, members of the public
	* organisational systems – HR, administration

* does everybody know the appropriate terminology?
	* terms like “cis”, “trans” and “non-binary”, “gender identity”
	* a lot of trans people will know these terms, but there will be people who’ve never had to think about trans issues before

* how should colleagues react?
	* trans-inclusion training
	* how to be an ally

* what laws are applicable?
	* some policies referred to laws – EQ 2010, GRA 2004, Data Protection Act
	* GDPR not mentioned yet, but assume is a time issue
	* anti-discrimination laws
	* laws are a minimum. Do better!

* how do you transition at work?
	* timeline? Plan? Who collaborates on that?
	* are there specific members of HR to talk to?
	* how do you tell people? / communicate
	* new hires?
	* facilities, bathrooms, dress code
	* complaint procedures e.g. harassment/misgendering
	* lack of support? Confidentiality? Sensitivity?
	* how do you want to be treated?
	* indicate preferred name / identifiers
	* sample scripts + questions – see AAMVERS
	* build a support system

* how does a manager support a transitioning managee?
	* what’s best behaviour? Affirmation, input, develop a plan
	* what support does the organisation offer?
	* don’t “out” without consent

* what HR systems need updating?
	* e.g. payroll, company directory, business cards
	* each org has different stuff, name badges
	* IT systems, records

* what costs of transitioning do you cover?
	* e.g. surgery, therapy, doctor visits
	* be specific about what you cover
	* time off for medical leave?
	* time off for appointments
	* family members?
	* absence management related to gender transition

* what external orgs?
	* Mermaids, GIRES, Gender Intelligence
	* NHS
	* Employee Assistance Programme
	* Trans*Formation

These are the topics that were discussed consistently, which you might want to consider putting in your policies:

## Acknowledgements

## Closing thoughts

This is just part of a bigger conversation at Wellcome about how we do a better job of trans inclusion.

Expect to see me think about this more
