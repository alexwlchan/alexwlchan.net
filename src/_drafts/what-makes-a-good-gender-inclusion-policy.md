A week or so ago, I tweeted a question to my followers:

{% tweet https://twitter.com/alexwlchan/status/1126802445517099008 %}

Better trans inclusion is one of the focuses for the LGBTQ+ Staff network and the [Diversity & Inclusion team][d&i] this year.

Because I've never been at an organisation that has a gender inclusion policy, I don't know what "good" looks like.
I can guess at what might be useful, but that's not the same as seeing some real policies.
I know I have a lot of trans followers on Twitter, so I was hoping I'd get a few replies to guide my thinking -- and I was pleasantly surprised by the response!

Dozens of people reached out with suggestions, pointing me to policies and good practices at their own organisation or others, and giving me lots of material to read.
I'm incredibly grateful to everybody who sent me a message.
It was useful to read policies from a variety of places, and think about the challenges people face in different roles.

In this post, I'm going to go through some of the common themes I spotted.
These are just my initial notes: as we actually write the policy and have more conversations, I expect I'll have more thoughts.

## Why have a policy?

For me, an inclusion policy is about setting expectations.

If you're part of a minority group that often comes in for harassment or abuse -- whether that's by gender, race, disability, or something else -- a policy sets the tone for how you should be treated at work.

If there isn't a policy, you're relying on the individual interpretations of your team or manager, which might be unclear or unfriendly.
If you're trans but not out at work, it's scary to come out if you're not sure how the organisation will react.
(Coming out is almost always scary, but knowing you're supported should hopefully make it easier!)
A policy establishes what is and isn't acceptable behaviour, and gives you a way to push back if you face undue hostility.

It's a visible commitment to treating people with dignity and respect.



## How do you write a policy?

Writing good policy is about asking questions.
What scenarios might somebody face?
How do we handle those as an organisation?
How do we respond?
Every organisation will have different scenarios, and different answers -- you can't just copy somebody else's policy wholesale.

This means thinking about your entire organisation -- everybody in it, everybody they interact with.

And it means making hard decisions -- there isn't always an easy, correct answer.
Often the most valuable part of writing policy isn't the policy itself, but the conversations you have as you're writing it.


## What goes into a policy?

If policy is about asking questions, which questions do we need to ask?

Every organisation will have slightly different questions -- but there are lots of similarities.
Below I've collected some of the most common ones.
We'll need to answer these when we write our policy at Wellcome, and you could use them as a starting point too.

*   **What's the point of the policy?**

    I've discussed why I think you need a policy above.
    Most policies I read had a similar statement as the first section.
    Common goals included:

    *   To provide appropriate support to trans employees
    *   To guarantee privacy and confidentiality
    *   To encourage a gender diverse working environment

    Alongside that, most of the policies had a section about the organisation's key values.
    Common ones:

    <ul>
      <li>
        Trans people exist.
        They have the right to self-identify as their chosen gender, and to be treated with respect and dignity.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Transition is an individual process.
        That can include medical, legal, or social transition -- or some combination of the three.</p>
        <p>A common assumption is that transition is just about medical intervention (which isn't always desired or possible).
        You don't have to transition medically to be trans.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Gender isn't a binary.
        There's a spectrum of people who are neither male nor female.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

*   **Who is the policy for?**

    Most of the policies had separate sections for each of these groups:

    *   An individual who is trans or transitioning
    *   Other people in the organisation who work with them -- for example, managers or coworkers
    *   People outside the organisation who they interact with -- customers, supplies, clients, etc.
    *   The administrative systems -- HR, company directory, email addresses, and so on

    Each of these groups will have need to be handled differently.
    For example, a person who's transitioning will have different questions and concerns to their manager or somebody in HR.

    <!-- A lot of the policies acknowledged that when somebody comes out as trans at work, it's probably their manager's first time managing somebody who's trans.
    You need to provide support for the managers and coworkers, not just the trans employee. -->

    The best policies drilled down into more detail in each group.
    For example, the university policies distinguished between staff and students.
    Or they'd differentiate between "immediate team members" and "the rest of the organisation".

    At Wellcome, we'll need to pick apart that "people outside the organisation" group.
    It's quite large and diverse -- members of the public in Wellcome Collection, people whose grants we fund, policymakers at external organisations, and lots of others.
    In most cases, I expect we already have a policy, and it's a case of joining the dots.
    (I expect there's a line in our grant conditions about treating Wellcome staff with respect; we'd have to make sure that covers transphobic harassment.)

*   **Does everybody know the appropriate terminology?**

    Phrases like "cis", "trans", "non-binary" and "gender identity" -- if you're close to trans people, you probably know these terms, but plenty of people will never have come across them before.

    Lots of policies had a glossary to explain the key words and terms.

*   **What laws are applicable?**

    Some policies referred to specific laws that affect inclusion, including:

    *   The Gender Recognition Act 2004
    *   The Equality Act 2010
    *   The Data Protection Act 1998

    The DPA 1998 was mentioned in the context of allowing trans people to update their details in company systems -- for example, changing their name in the company directory.
    I didn't see anybody mention GDPR, but it covers similar ground and I'd expect newer policies to mention it.

*   **How do you transition at work?**

    Every person's transition is different, and you can't prescribe a course of action -- but you can signpost ways the organisation can help.

    Several policies talked about creating a timeline, by talking to managers and/or HR.
    Key milestones in a timeline include:

    *   Are you going to change your name?
        (Not everybody does.)
        If so, when?
    *   When are you going to start presenting at work as your chosen gender?
    *   When do you want to start being address with your new name and/or new pronouns
    *   How and when do you want to tell your immediate team?
        The wider organisation?
        Clients and customers?
        (As appropriate.)

    There were also pointers to related workplace rules or policies, such as:

    <ul>
      <li>
        When can you start using the bathrooms of your chosen gender?
      </li>
      <li>
        What do you do if you get harassed or misgendered, or if somebody outs you without your consent?
        What's the organisation's grievance policy?
      </li>
      <li>
        Does the organisation have a dress code?
        If it's gendered, when can you start wearing the clothes of your chosen gender?
      </li>
      <li>
        Do you want to tell people who were hired after you transitioned?
        If so, when?
      </li>
    </ul>

*   **How can colleagues/managers support somebody who's transitioning?**

    Policies talking about ways the colleague/manager could support the individual, for example:

    *   Let them drive the process -- transition is an individual process, and they should decide if, how and when they want to do things
    *   Offer assurance and affirmation of their chosen gender
    *   Help them develop a plan for announcing the change to the rest of the organisation
    *   Ensure confidentiality: don't out them without consent
    *   Help to address the concerns of colleagues and clients -- don't put it all on the individual

*   **How can the organisation support the colleagues/managers of somebody who's trans?**

    I liked the policies that acknowledged that trans people in the workplace are still relatively rare -- for many colleagues and managers, if a trans person comes out, it's the first time they've been working with/managing a visibly trans person.
    They may feel under pressure to not make mistakes, in a topic where they don't have any experience.

    Some organisations offered to help these people:

    *   Providing explicit guidelines in the policy itself (see above)
    *   Running training about trans inclusion and being a good trans ally
    *   Pointers to external organisations with trans expertise (see below)

*   **What HR systems need updating?**

    Many trans people choose a new name, title and pronouns that are more congruent with their chosen gender.
    You probably have lots of systems that use their existing name: payroll, company directory, business cards, email addresses.
    It's useful to have a list of all the places where you might need to update somebody's name or gender markers, and include those in the transition guidelines.

    You probably have part of this list already.
    People often change their name when they get married, and somebody in HR will know where their name needs updating -- you can reuse that list.

*   **Do you cover the costs of medical transition?**

    If somebody is undergoing medical transition in the UK, they have two choices:

    *   Wait for the NHS (less expensive, waiting time of years)
    *   Seek private treatment (faster, but more expensive)

    Treatments might include things like therapy, hormones, and surgery

    If your organisation provides private health insurance, consider whether it covers the costs associated with transitioning.
    This is still quite unusual in the UK (I think it's more common in the US), but that's changing.
    Several of the organisations I looked at (including Accenture, Herbert Smith Freehills, Starbucks) explicitly cover the costs of medical transition in their healthcare plans.

    The best policies I read were extremely thorough and detailed.
    They stated exactly which treatments are and aren't covered, and who they're covered for.
    (For example, Accenture covers dependent family members and partners as well as their employees.)

    If you can't cover the medical costs, do you have a policy for medical leave?
    Most policies had a statement to the effect "it is okay to take medical leave for transition-related appointments".

*   **How do you handle absences related to transition?**

    Transitioning can involve lots of extra appoointments: therapy sessions, doctor's appointments, surgery.
    Some forms of surgery have long recovery times: typically measured in months, not weeks.

    What are the rules around taking medical leave?
    Is it okay for somebody to take medical leave for transition-related appointments?

*   **Which external organisations are worth talking to?**

    The same names kept coming up: [Mermaids](https://www.mermaidsuk.org.uk/), [GIRES](https://www.gires.org.uk/), [Gendered Intelligence](http://genderedintelligence.co.uk/), [Trans*Formation](http://www.interbanklgbtforum.co.uk/transformation-network/).

    At least two of them (GIRES and Gendered Intelligence) offer paid training and consulting services, which might be useful for non-trans employees.


## A possible outline

With all that in mind, here's a brief outline I've written as a starting point for discussions at Wellcome:

*   Goals and values
*   Definitions/glossary

*   What to do if:
    -   You're trans or transitioning
    -   You manage somebody who's trans or transitioning
    -   You work with somebody who's trans or transitioning

*   Administrative matters and benefits
    -   Use of facilities
    -   Identity management, updating compnay directory, and so on
    -   Medical leave
    -   Healthcare benefits

*   Links to other organisations

And as we write the policy, we'll expand each of those sections in more detail, guided by some of the questions above.



## Acknowledgements

I'm grateful to everybody who reached out to offer suggestions, links or help.
I read it all, and it gave me a lot to think about (and I think I've replied to everything -- ping me if you think I've missed something).
You can see many of those people in the replies to that tweet.
I also had several people reach out privately, some of whom are trans but not out in public/their workplace.

Thank you everybody for your help!

If you have time, do read the policies I've linked above -- they'll give you more idea of the sort of detail they go into.
And if you know of other good ones, please let me know.



## Closing thoughts

This is just part of a bigger conversation at Wellcome about how we do a better job of trans inclusion.
A policy is part of that, but there's more we can do -- I'll be thinking about it more over the next few months, and hopefully I'll write about some of it here.
