A week or so ago, I tweeted a question to my followers:

{% tweet https://twitter.com/alexwlchan/status/1126802445517099008 %}

Better trans inclusion is one of the focuses for the LGBTQ+ Staff network this year, and I know I have a lot of trans followers on Twitter.
I was hoping I'd get a few replies that might guide our work -- and I was pleasantly surprised by the response.

Dozens of people reached out with suggestions, pointing me to policies and good practices at their own organisation or others, and giving me lots of material to read.
I'm incredibly grateful to everybody who sent me a message.
It was useful to read policies from a variety of places, and think about the challenges people face in different roles.

In this post, I'm going to go through some of the common themes I spotted.



## Why have a policy?

For me, an inclusion policy is about setting expectations.

If you're part of a minority group that often comes in for harassment or abuse -- whether that's by gender, race, disability, or something else -- a policy sets the tone for how you should be treated at work.

If there isn't a policy, you're relying on the individual interpretations of your team or manager, which might be unclear or unfriendly.
If you're trans but not out at work, it's scary to come out if you're not sure how the organisation will react.
(Coming out is almost always scary, but knowing you're supported should hopefully make it easier!)
A policy establishes what is and isn't acceptable behaviour, and gives you a way to push back if you face undue hostility.

It's a visible commitment to treating people with dignity and respect.



## How do you write a policy?

Writing good policy is about asking questions.
What scenarios might somebody face?
How do we handle those as an organisation?
How do we respond?
Every organisation will have different scenarios, and different answers -- you can't just copy somebody else's policy wholesale.

This means thinking about your entire organisation -- everybody in it, everybody they interact with.

And it means making hard decisions -- there isn't always an easy, correct answer.
Often the most valuable part of writing policy isn't the policy itself, but the conversations you have as you're writing it.


## What goes into a policy?

If policy is about asking questions, which questions do we need to ask?

Every organisation will have slightly different questions -- but there are lots of similarities.
Below I've collected some of the most common ones.
We'll need to answer these when we write our policy at Wellcome, and you could use them as a starting point too.

*   **What's the point of the policy?**

    I've discussed why I think you need a policy above.
    Most policies I read had a similar statement as the first section.
    Common goals included:

    *   To provide appropriate support to trans employees
    *   To guarantee privacy and confidentiality
    *   To encourage a gender diverse working environment

    Alongside that, most of the policies had a section about the organisation's key values.
    Common ones:

    <ul>
      <li>
        Trans people exist.
        They have the right to self-identify as their chosen gender, and to be treated with respect and dignity.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Transition is an individual process.
        That can include medical, legal, or social transition -- or some combination of the three.</p>
        <p>A common assumption is that transition is just about medical intervention (which isn't always desired or possible).
        You don't have to transition medically to be trans.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Gender isn't a binary.
        There's a spectrum of people who are neither male nor female.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

*   **Who is the policy for?**

    Most of the policies had separate sections for each of these groups:

    *   An individual who is trans or transitioning
    *   Other people in the organisation who work with them -- for example, managers or coworkers
    *   People outside the organisation who they interact with -- customers, supplies, clients, and so on
    *   The administrative systems -- HR, company directory, email addresses, and so on

    Each of these groups will have need to be handled differently.
    For example, a person who's transitioning will have different questions and concerns to their manager or somebody in HR.

    A lot of the policies acknowledged that when somebody comes out as trans at work, it's probably their manager's first time managing somebody who's trans.
    You need to provide support for the managers and coworkers, not just the trans employee.

    The best policies drilled down into more detail in each group.
    For example, the university policies distinguished between staff and students.
    Or they'd differentiate between "immediate team members" and "the rest of the organisation".

    At Wellcome, we'll need to pick apart that "people outside the organisation" group.
    It's quite large and diverse -- members of the public in Wellcome Collection, people whose grants we fund, policymakers at external organisations, and lots of others.
    In most cases, I expect we already have a policy, and it's a case of joining the dots.
    (I expect there's a line in our grant conditions about treating Wellcome staff with respect; we'd have to make sure that covers transphobic harassment.)

*   **Does everybody know the appropriate terminology?**

    Phrases like "cis", "trans", "non-binary" and "gender identity" -- if you're close to trans people, you probably know these terms, but plenty of people will never have come across them before.

    Lots of policies had a glossary to explain the key words and terms.

*   **What laws are applicable?**

    Some policies referred to specific laws that affect inclusion, including:

    *   The Gender Recognition Act 2004
    *   The Equality Act 2010
    *   The Data Protection Act 1998

    The DPA 1998 was mentioned in the context of allowing trans people to update their details in company systems -- for example, changing their name in the company directory.
    I didn't see anybody mention GDPR, but it covers similar ground and I'd expect newer policies to mention it.

*   **How do you transition at work?**

    Every person's transition is different, and you can't prescribe a course of action -- but you can signpost

## Acknowledgements

## Closing thoughts

This is just part of a bigger conversation at Wellcome about how we do a better job of trans inclusion.

Expect to see me think about this more
