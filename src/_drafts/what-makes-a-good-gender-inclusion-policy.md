Policies vary for externals, e.g. grant holders

The policy is less important than the questions you ask to get there

# What does a good gender inclusion policy look like?

Every year Stonewall report about LGBTQ+ inclusion in workplace
Wellcome was dinged by Stonewall for trans inclusion – or lack, thereof
several people have expressed surprise that we don’t have a policy
LGBTQ+ Network + D&I team is taking steps to remedy!
A week ago, I put up a tweet asking:

(( tweet ))

I have a few trans friends, thought they might have some suggestions
I got an overwhelming response – dozens of people reached out to suggest policies, offer help
incredibly grateful
in this post, going to explain the common themes/trends

note: written from a uk focus
my impression is that the US is a bit further along in this regard, but don’t know detail

## Why have a policy?

Table stakes for this post:
* Trans people exist, everyone has a right to self-identity as chosen gender, to be treated with respect and dignity

SO not about value of inclusion, but about having a policy specifically? Why write one proactively? Why not wait until you have a trans employee? (Or at least one who’s visibly trans)

These questions all apply to any sort of inclusion policy, not just gender — also race, religion, disability, and so on.

* Establish consistent, best practices
* Set expectations for how somebody will eb treated
* Feel safer at work

## Why have your own policy?

Policy is a statement of an org’s values
If you just copy somebody else’s, may not fit – values may be different

also different orgs have different policy styles

e.g. one big corp (10k+) had a very detailed policy
lists and tables and every eventuality covered

wellcome policies tend to be more light touch – lay out broad principles, and specific details only written as they’re decided

(think statutory law vs case law)

Provide appropriate support + respect
Privacy and confidentiality
gender diverse working environment

## What questions do you need to ask?

* statement of high-level values
	* assume open and respectful discussion
	* acknowledge that trans is a multi-step process, different definitions – not necessarily medical intervention, not always possible, doesn’t invalidate; social/medical/legal transition
	* individual process
	* not just binary

* recognise that a policy is for different people
	* somebody who is trans or transitioning
	* people who work with them – managers, coworkers
	* external people – clients, customers, members of the public
	* organisational systems – HR, administration

* does everybody know the appropriate terminology?
	* terms like “cis”, “trans” and “non-binary”, “gender identity”
	* a lot of trans people will know these terms, but there will be people who’ve never had to think about trans issues before

* how should colleagues react?
	* trans-inclusion training
	* how to be an ally

* what laws are applicable?
	* some policies referred to laws – EQ 2010, GRA 2004, Data Protection Act
	* GDPR not mentioned yet, but assume is a time issue
	* anti-discrimination laws
	* laws are a minimum. Do better!

* how do you transition at work?
	* timeline? Plan? Who collaborates on that?
	* are there specific members of HR to talk to?
	* how do you tell people? / communicate
	* new hires?
	* facilities, bathrooms, dress code
	* complaint procedures e.g. harassment/misgendering
	* lack of support? Confidentiality? Sensitivity?
	* how do you want to be treated?
	* indicate preferred name / identifiers
	* sample scripts + questions – see AAMVERS
	* build a support system

* how does a manager support a transitioning managee?
	* what’s best behaviour? Affirmation, input, develop a plan
	* what support does the organisation offer?
	* don’t “out” without consent

* what HR systems need updating?
	* e.g. payroll, company directory, business cards
	* each org has different stuff, name badges
	* IT systems, records

* what costs of transitioning do you cover?
	* e.g. surgery, therapy, doctor visits
	* be specific about what you cover
	* time off for medical leave?
	* time off for appointments
	* family members?
	* absence management related to gender transition

* what external orgs?
	* Mermaids, GIRES, Gender Intelligence
	* NHS
	* Employee Assistance Programme
	* Trans*Formation

These are the topics that were discussed consistently, which you might want to consider putting in your policies:

## Acknowledgements

## Closing thoughts

This is just part of a bigger conversation at Wellcome about how we do a better job of trans inclusion.
