title: I deleted all my tweets
summary: I used TweetDeleter to delete about 35,000 tweets, and cut my remaining ties to the site formerly known as Twitter.

I had a complicated relationship with Twitter (now X).

I wasted a lot of time there, got into some embarrassing arguments, and posted tweets I now regret.
But it's also where I met friends and partners, started a career in cultural heritage, and found a lot of knowledge and joy.
Maybe one day I'll write a longer article about exactly what Twitter meant to me.

But I haven't been active on Twitter for several years, and I finally decided to remove all my old tweets.
I paid $7.99 to [TweetDeleter.com](https://tweetdeleter.com/), and a week later all of my tweets are gone.
I'll post one final tweet linking to this article and telling my followers where else to find me on the web, but after that I'm done with Twitter.

## Why?

I felt like I was getting very little benefit to leaving them up, but I was feeling increasingly uncomfortable about it.

*   I don't think many people were reading them and if there was anything useful there it was hard to find.
*   I kept getting notifications from people who'd found an old tweet, and wanted to start an argument or hurl abuse in my direction.
    I can do without that.
*   Those tweets are an increasingly outdated representation of how I think and feel.
    Because I haven't tweeted in about two years, anything I've learnt in that time isn't represented there.
    My old tweets felt like a liability; something that could be dug up to criticise me for a view I no longer hold.

I already did this once -- at some point, I deleted all my tweets from before 2017, because they had a lot of personal stuff I no longer wanted to be publicly available.
Absolutely nobody noticed or cared when I did that, and I think this time will be much the same.

A lot of people I know deleted their accounts in November because of the Terms of Service update that would allow X to use posts to train AI models.
While I understand the concern, that wasn't a big issue for me.
I already know my writing has been used to train AI models, including my tweets -- just like pretty much anything else that was publicly available on the web.
I don't think deleting my tweets will affect that.

I considered deleting my entire account, but I wanted to leave it up as a signpost to where I'm writing/posting now.
I don't think there's too much risk in having an account that just says "no longer here, look over there".

## How?

I had about 35,000 tweets I wanted to remove.

I experimented with a few DIY automations, but I couldn't get anything working quickly.
I decided to pay $7.99 for one month of [TweetDeleter.com's Unlimited plan](https://tweetdeleter.com/pricing) -- a couple of friends had already used it to delete their accounts, and I'd rather pay a token amount than spend more of my time on it.

I had to upload a copy of my Twitter archive so they knew which posts to delete, and then it took about a week to delete everything.
They seemed to be deleting in batches of 100 at a time, presumably spread out among everyone else deleting tweets at the same time.

Interestingly, X says that I still have 407 posts, but you can't see any on my profile:

{%
  picture
  filename="remaining_tweets.png"
  width="372"
  alt="Screenshot of my profile on X, showing “407 posts”."
  class="screenshot"
%}

I think these are probably retweets of posts that are no longer accessible to me -- the original tweeter has either blocked me, or made their account private.
I can't unretweet it because I can't see it, but nor does it appear in my profile.

## What's next?

I'm going to post a link to this article on Twitter, and then log out.

I haven't found a good replacement for Twitter -- although I have accounts on [Mastodon](https://social.alexwlchan.net/@alex) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/alexwlchan.bsky.social), neither of them feel like the best days of Twitter.
I'm still doing the sort of microblogging I used to do on Twitter, but it's either in the ["today I learned" section](/til/) of this site, or in my private journal.

I joined Twitter in August 2009 and a lot of good things came out of it, but after fifteen years, it feels like that era of my life is over.
