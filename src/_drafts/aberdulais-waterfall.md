Last month I was in Cardiff to help organise [PyCon UK][pyconuk].
I had a huge amount of fun at the conference, but running a five-day event gets quite tiring.
This year I took a few days of holiday in Cardiff, so I could unwind before returning home.
Unfortunately [heavy storms][bronagh] kept me inside for several days, but I did venture out at the end of the week.

Aberdulais is a village in south Wales, about 45 minutes from Cardiff, and a place with a long industrial history.
It has easy supplies of coal and wood, and it sits atop a powerful river -- the River Dulais.
Today the site is owned and looked after by the National Trust, and I decided to go have a look.

<!-- (Etymology note: the word _Aberdulais_ is Welsh for _mouth of the river Dulais_.
_Aber_ is a Celtic prefix that appears in [lots of place names][aber_name].
More well-known examples are places like Aberdeen and Aberystwyth.) -->

In autumn 1584, German engineer Ulrich Frosse had developed a new way to smelt copper, but he wanted to keep his process safe from "pryinge eyes".
The Welsh countryside is nice and quiet, so he set up a smelting works in Aberdulais -- the first in Wales.
The copper ore was mined in Cornwall, the coal and charcoal supplied from nearby Neath, and a waterwheel on the river powered the site.

If you're interested, I found a [lecture about copper smelting from 1880][lecture] that gives more detail about the history of smelting in Wales.

The [National Trust page](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/aberdulais-tin-works-and-waterfall/features/aberdulais-an-industrial-revolution-since-1584) says the copper was used in coins minted for Queen Elizabeth I.
I tried to find some pictures of the coins, but I could only find coins that were created sometime during her reign -- nothing about where their copper was smelted.
Based on dates, I think it would have been her sixth batch of coins, such as this [sixth issue pound][six_pound], but that's a total guess.

Over time, Aberdulais became a site of different industries -- textile milling, cloth production, even a flour mill -- then in 1831, it became the site of a tinplate works.
[Tin plating][tinning] is the process of coating thin sheets of iron or steel with tin, so they don't rust.
It's useful for things like cooking utensils, and canned food.

Wales had an incredibly successful tin plating industry -- so much so that the US slapped [massive tariffs][tariffs] on it, and shut the whole thing down.

So what's it like to visit?

<!-- summary -->

The car park is just across the road from the entrance, and I couldn't see the falls as I was walking up.
But as I approached, I could see a broken bridge, and feel the power of the water crashing against it:

I went in, picked up a leaflet and a map, and started wandering around.

On the other side of the entrance, I could get a closer look at the bridge I'd seen from the road.
You can see it's partially broken off, and there's a fence to stop people falling off the end:

This was originally a bridge meant for horses -- a tramway that led directly into the site, giving a way to carry materials in and out of the site.
The horse-drawn carts would bring in the raw materials for the tinplate process, and later take out the finished product.

Like much of Aberdulais, the village and port are long since gone.
The opposite side of the tramway is completely overgrown, and even if the bridge was rebuilt it wouldn't go anywhere.
Only a few remnants remain, such as the carts and the tracks they'd have run on:

</figure>

The horses needed a place to stop, rest, be fed and be re-shoed.
Opposite the tramway were some stables and a blacksmith.

The stable buildings are still standing today, and they're housing an exhibition about the tinplate process.
It explains the different roles, what the process involves, and has examples of objects coated with tin.
Most of the display is based on people who actually lived and worked at Aberdulais.
It includes a variety of pictures and illustrations showing what the process looked like.

It had just started to rain, so I was glad of an excuse to duck inside and start reading!

Once the weather had dried up, I ventured back outside, and I started wandering around the site.
You see remains of the buildings, all part of the old tin works.
There's so little left, it's quite hard to imagine what the buildings would have looked like -- but you get an idea of the space they occupied.
