Last month I was in Cardiff to help organise [PyCon UK][pyconuk].
I had a huge amount of fun at the conference, but running a five-day event gets quite tiring.
This year I took a few days of holiday in Cardiff, so I could unwind before returning home.
Unfortunately [heavy storms][bronagh] kept me inside for several days, but I did venture out at the end of the week.

Aberdulais is a village in south Wales, about 45 minutes from Cardiff, and a place with a long industrial history.
It has easy supplies of coal and wood, and it sits atop a powerful river -- the River Dulais.
Today the site is owned and looked after by the National Trust, and I decided to go have a look.

<!-- (Etymology note: the word _Aberdulais_ is Welsh for _mouth of the river Dulais_.
_Aber_ is a Celtic prefix that appears in [lots of place names][aber_name].
More well-known examples are places like Aberdeen and Aberystwyth.) -->

In autumn 1584, German engineer Ulrich Frosse had developed a new way to smelt copper, but he wanted to keep his process safe from "pryinge eyes".
The Welsh countryside is nice and quiet, so he set up a smelting works in Aberdulais -- the first in Wales.
The copper ore was mined in Cornwall, the coal and charcoal supplied from nearby Neath, and a waterwheel on the river powered the site.

If you're interested, I found a [lecture about copper smelting from 1880][lecture] that gives more detail about the history of smelting in Wales.

The [National Trust page](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/aberdulais-tin-works-and-waterfall/features/aberdulais-an-industrial-revolution-since-1584) says the copper was used in coins minted for Queen Elizabeth I.
I tried to find some pictures of the coins, but I could only find coins that were created sometime during her reign -- nothing about where their copper was smelted.
Based on dates, I think it would have been her sixth batch of coins, such as this [sixth issue pound][six_pound], but that's a total guess.

Over time, Aberdulais became a site of different industries -- textile milling, cloth production, even a flour mill -- then in 1831, it became the site of a tinplate works.
[Tin plating][tinning] is the process of coating thin sheets of iron or steel with tin, so they don't rust.
It's useful for things like cooking utensils, and canned food.

Wales had an incredibly successful tin plating industry -- so much so that the US slapped [massive tariffs][tariffs] on it, and shut the whole thing down.

So what's it like to visit?

<!-- summary -->

The car park is just across the road from the entrance, and I couldn't see the falls as I was walking up.
But as I approached, I could see a broken bridge, and feel the power of the water crashing against it:

<figure class="wide_img">
  {% wide_image 2018/P9210017 %}
</figure>

I went in, picked up a leaflet and a map, and started wandering around.

On the other side of the entrance, I could get a closer look at the bridge I'd seen from the road.
You can see it's partially broken off, and there's a fence to stop people falling off the end:

<figure class="wide_img">
  {% wide_image 2018/P9210069 %}
</figure>

This was originally a bridge meant for horses -- a tramway that led directly into the site, giving a way to carry materials in and out of the site.
The horse-drawn carts would bring in the raw materials for the tinplate process, and later take out the finished product.

Like much of Aberdulais, the village and port are long since gone.
The opposite side of the tramway is completely overgrown, and even if the bridge was rebuilt it wouldn't go anywhere.
Only a few remnants remain, such as the carts and the tracks they'd have run on:

<figure class="wide_img">
  {% wide_image 2018/P9210080 %}
</figure>

The horses needed a place to stop, rest, be fed and be re-shoed.
Opposite the tramway were some stables and a blacksmith.

The stable buildings are still standing today, and they're housing an exhibition about the tinplate process.
It explains the different roles, what the process involves, and has examples of objects coated with tin.
Most of the display is based on people who actually lived and worked at Aberdulais.
It includes a variety of pictures and illustrations showing what the process looked like.

It had just started to rain, so I was glad of an excuse to duck inside and start reading!

<figure class="wide_img">
  {% wide_image 2018/P9210111 %}
</figure>

Once the weather had dried up, I ventured back outside, and I started wandering around the site.
You see remains of the buildings, all part of the old tin works.
As you wander round, you start to get an idea of the space the old tin works occupied.

<figure class="wide_img">
  {% wide_image 2018/P9210125 %}
  <figcaption>
    The last remaining corner of what was presumably once an entire room.
    You can see the edge of the river running in the background.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure class="wide_img">
  {% wide_image 2018/P9210124 %}
  <figcaption>
    A view into a partially surviving room.
    I wonder what the slats in the far wall were for?
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure class="wide_img">
  {% wide_image 2018/P9210392 %}
  <figcaption>
    In some places the outline is all that's left.
    And again those slats on the far wall.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure class="wide_img">
  {% wide_image 2018/P9210403 %}
  <figcaption>
    A slightly wider view.
    Some walls have survived better than others, and in a few places look almost complete.
    You can also see a glimpse of the waterfall in the background &ndash; more on that in a moment.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Unfortunately there aren't many details of what the buildings were used for -- when the site was abandoned, the buildings were left to decay.
Anything useful was taken away to the other tin plating works in Aberdulais (the "Lower Works", while the National Trust site was the "Upper Works").
There are signs suggesting what some of the buildings were for, but they're incomplete.

One thing that clearly stands out is the chimney, which towers above the site.

<figure style="width: 600px;">
  {% wide_image 2018/P9210142 %}
</figure>

Based on the signs, I think this was the chimney for the [annealing furnace][annealing].
Annealing is the process of heating iron and steel to very high temperatures, allowing the internal structure to rearrange, and then cooling it back down.
The effect is making the plates less brittle and more malleable, so the tinplates can be shaped without breaking.

At the base of the chimney, you can see what looks like the remains of a furnace:

<figure class="wide_img">
  {% wide_image 2018/P9210147 %}
</figure>

Another large structures was the "tin house".

After the iron plates had been flattened and rolled into thin sheets, they'd be brought here to be dipped in molten tin.
They'd be coated with tin, then plunged into hot oil, which gave the plates a smooth and even finish.
Once left to cool, they'd be the finished product -- the prized tinplate.
This process was done entirely by hand, and one of the more senior roles at the tin plate works, and it all happened in the tin house.

<figure class="wide_img">
  {% wide_image 2018/P9210348 %}
  <figcaption>
    Looking into the remains of the tin house from one corner...
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure class="wide_img">
  {% wide_image 2018/P9210349 %}
  <figcaption>
    ...and looking back through the other corner.
    That overhang in the corner became a place to hide from another brief shower of rain!
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Dotted around the site are a variety of small objects related to tin plating or the site's industrial history.
Each of them has a small, handwritten sign explaining its significance:
For example:

<figure class="wide_img">
  {% wide_image 2018/P9210390 %}
  <figcaption>
    The sign reads <em>&ldquo;A door from one of the furnaces which were used to reheat the iron for working into sheet [sic] in the rolling mill&rdquo;</em>.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

And since we're in Wales, those signs are also translated into Welsh:

<figure class="wide_img">
  {% wide_image 2018/P9210363 %}
  <figcaption>
    The sign reads <em>&ldquo;Dyma siglur: Defynyddiwyd i drosglwyddor symudiad troi cynhyrehiwyd gan yr olwyn Ddwr rhwng y felin rholio&rdquo;</em>.
    In English, that means <em>&ldquo;This is a wobbler. These were used to transmit the rotary movement produced by the waterwheel between the rolling mill&rdquo;</em>.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Near the tin house, there's something even bigger -- a drive shaft from one of the machines that used to work there, although I have no idea what machine it might have been a part of.

<figure class="wide_img">
  {% wide_image 2018/P9210353 %}
</figure>

But if you follow the river, and climb to the top of the site, you get to the really impressive bit -- the waterfall.
This is the reason so much industry happened at Aberdulais.
It's a cheap, abundant source of energy, and even just standing near it you feel the power of the water.

This is a picture from lower down in the site: you can see the two main waterfalls.
The lower is covered in spray, the upper forms a sheet of water coming over the top.

<figure class="wide_img">
  {% wide_image 2018/P9210408 %}
</figure>

The sun came out as I wandered around, and I can see miniature rainbows in the spray coming off the falls.
Here's a picture of one in the spray of the lower waterfall:

<figure class="wide_img">
  {% wide_image 2018/P9210413 %}
</figure>

And because I was standing so close, I could change the shape of the rainbow with very little movement.
Here's a second picture taken a few feet to the right.
Even a small movement affects the optics.
The rainbow is just as intense, but it's a noticeably different arc.

<figure class="wide_img">
  {% wide_image 2018/P9210415 %}
</figure>

Both these rainbow pictures come straight from my camera, with just a bit of cropping.
I didn't do anything to boost the colour or brightness -- the rainbows really are that visible!
