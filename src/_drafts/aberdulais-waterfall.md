Last month I was in Cardiff to help organise [PyCon UK][pyconuk].
I had a huge amount of fun at the conference, but running a five-day event gets quite tiring.
This year I took a few days of holiday in Cardiff, so I could unwind before returning home.
Unfortunately [heavy storms][bronagh] kept me inside for several days, but I did venture out at the end of the week.

Aberdulais is a village in south Wales, about 45 minutes from Cardiff, and a place with a long industrial history.
It has easy supplies of coal and wood, and it sits atop a powerful river -- the River Dulais.
Today the site is owned and looked after by the National Trust, and I decided to go have a look.

<!-- (Etymology note: the word _Aberdulais_ is Welsh for _mouth of the river Dulais_.
_Aber_ is a Celtic prefix that appears in [lots of place names][aber_name].
More well-known examples are places like Aberdeen and Aberystwyth.) -->

In autumn 1584, German engineer Ulrich Frosse had developed a new way to smelt copper, but he wanted to keep his process safe from "pryinge eyes".
The Welsh countryside is nice and quiet, so he set up a smelting works in Aberdulais -- the first in Wales.
The copper ore was mined in Cornwall, the coal and charcoal supplied from nearby Neath, and a waterwheel on the river powered the site.

There's a [lecture about copper smelting from 1880][lecture] that gives more detail about the history of smelting in Wales (albeit a biased view).

The [National Trust page](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/aberdulais-tin-works-and-waterfall/features/aberdulais-an-industrial-revolution-since-1584) says the copper was used in coins minted for Queen Elizabeth I.
I tried to find some pictures of the coins, but I could only find coins that were created sometime during her reign -- nothing about where their copper was smelted.
Based on dates, I think it would have been her sixth batch of coins, such as this [sixth issue pound][six_pound], but that's a total guess.
