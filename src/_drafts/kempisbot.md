title: How KempisBot works
summary: How I reincarnated a fifteenth-century monk and taught him to use Twitter.
tags: python twitter
---

A couple of weeks ago, I got a message from my friend Jay, asking if I'd help him build a Twitter bot to tweet [*The Imitation of Christ*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imitation_of_Christ) as a long Twitter thread:

<img src="/images/2021/messages_from_jay.png" style="width: 418px;">

At this point, I'd never heard of *The Imitation of Christ*, or its author Thomas à Kempis, nor did I have any idea of its theological significance.
I'm not religious, but I love a ridiculous scheme -- they're often the most fun -- so I agreed to help.

Jay has written [his own blog post](https://jayhulme.com/blog/kempisbot) about how he came up with this idea, and why it's an important book for Christians.
I recommend reading that if you want to understand the "why" of the project; here I'm going to explain the "how".

The bot posts a snippet from the book once every four hours, and [you can follow it at @KempisBot](https://twitter.com/kempisbot).
It's been running for about a fortnight, and already there are discussions springing up around the tweets.
I'm learning from the theology, and now I want to share some of the "tech magic".

I know plenty of KempisBot's followers aren't software developers, so I'm not going to go into the level of detail I usually do in my programming posts.
The goal of this post is to explain the key ideas I used to write this bot, not provide a blow-by-blow breakdown of the code.

(If you are a developer, you can [download my code](/files/2021/kempisbot.py).)

**The first thing I need is the text -- what should the bot tweet?**

This was all done by Jay.
He got a copy of the book from Project Gutenberg, and I asked him to insert three dashes (`---`) to break the text into tweet-sized chunks.
Here's the beginning of that file, which became the first three tweets:

> ‘The Imitation of Christ’, by Thomas à Kempis
>
> \-\-\-
>
> THE FIRST BOOK: Admonitions Profitable For The Spiritual Life
>
> \-\-\-
>
> CHAPTER I: Of the imitation of Christ, and of contempt of the world and all its vanities

There are lots of ways to store a list of tweets; I picked this because it made life simple for Jay.
He was able to do this entirely in a Google Doc, without learning any special software or syntax.

The choice of three dashes is arbitrary -- I just needed something that my code could use to tell where one tweet ends and the next begins.
Computers are very good at text manipulation, and splitting some text like this is a common operation.

**Now we know what to tweet, we need to post it on Twitter.**

If I want to post a tweet, I open twitter.com in my web browser, I type some text into the box, and I click the button labelled "Tweet".
This is a sort of contract between me and Twitter: if I do this set of actions correctly, they'll post my tweet and show it on twitter.com.

Programs can also have a contract with Twitter: if they do the correct set of actions, Twitter will post a tweet and show it on twitter.com.
This contract is called an *Application Programming Interface*, or *API*.
Rather than clicking buttons, a program works by sending special messages.

My program sends Twitter a message saying "please post this text as a new tweet".
Twitter's API will read the message, and reply to say "Yes, I posted that", "No, I didn't", or maybe "I don't understand what you were asking".
In turn, my program can read the reply, and decide what to do next.

I'm grossly oversimplifying, but I hope this gets across the general gist.
Computers can talk to each other by passing around special messages; I've not built a [*Wallace and Gromit*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_and_Gromit)-type robot with hands and arms to click and type.

**Finally, we want to post tweets on a schedule.**

Now I have a program that can post a single tweet, I want to run that program repeatedly.

I have a computer which is always turned on, and on that computer I have a program called [*cron*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron).
If I tell you the name is from the same root as "chronological" or "chronicle", you might be able to guess what it does -- cron is a program for running other programs, and to run them at a particular time.
For example, it could run a program every minute, or every hour, or at 2pm every Friday.

I have cron set up to run my "post tweet" program every four hours, so six times a day -- the book is 2170 tweets long, and this means the whole book will take 362 days, just shy of a year.

The first few tweets came out quite quickly -- cron is notoriously fiddly to set up, and I made a few mistakes when I was setting up the bot.
Fingers crossed, all fixed now!

This is only one way to build a Twitter bot, and I did it this way because it's very similar to other programs I've written.
There are plenty of other ways you could do something like this, none any better than the other -- it works, and that's good enough.

I hope this post has given you a bit more insight into how a Twitter bot works, especially if you don't know much about programming.
