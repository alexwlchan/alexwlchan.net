  I was chatting to a new colleague last week, and she asked about the picture that hangs behind me when I’m on video calls – which made me realise I’ve never posted about it here.
  It’s a rather nice piece that I’m quite pleased with, and it’s worth sharing.

Most of my backdrop is pretty dull: a closed white door and some grey walls.
I want to paint this room and add some colour, but disassembling my desk so I can redecorate is a challenge I have yet to tackle.
In the meantime, I added a small piece of art.

I deliberately picked something small but colourful.
I wanted to make my backdrop a bit more interesting than a grey wall, but I didn't want something too big.
I still want to be the main focus of my video, especially if I’m a post-it note sized tile in a large conference call.

This is what it looks like:
