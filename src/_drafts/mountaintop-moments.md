title: Mountaintop moments

I'm in an emotional slump this week.
I've just done back-to-back trips to Vermont and the Edinburgh Fringe, and I'm exhausted.
It was fun -- I got to meet new people, hang out with some Internet friends in-person, and see some great theatre -- but now I'm worn out.
I'm glad to be home and getting some rest, but another part of me also wishes I could go back.

This is a pretty common pattern: I do something exciting, it tires me out and I want to go home, but when I'm home I'm sad that the exciting thing is over.

I call events like these **mountaintop moments**.
They may not involve a literal mountain, but they're any event or experience where we can temporarily step away from our normal lives.
For me, they include conferences, holidays to new places, and days out with friends.

Being on the mountain means putting aside some of the routine of our daily lives.
With a bit of room to think and breathe, we can enjoy the view.
The air is cleaner, the sky and stars get closer, the world stretches out in front of us.
The mountaintop is larger than life.

The break in routine gives us space to grow.
We have new adventures, we discover new ideas, we meet new friends -- and we learn more about ourselves.

These intense, emotional events change us in ways we can't predict.
But exciting as they are, we eventually have to come down from the mountain, and it hurts.
All the energy and emotion is drained away as we return to our regular lives.

After a mountaintop moment, normal life can feel dull and subdued.
I always feel a sense of melancholy after a big event, and it takes me a few days to readjust.
I'm glad to return to the familiarity of my routine, and to have the opportunity to rest -- but I remember the emotional high, and nothing in my day-to-day can match it.

In the immediate aftermath, it's tempting to wonder if we can stay on the mountain.
What if we didn’t come down?
What if we made this our life?

But that’s not the point of the mountain -- we have to come down and return to our normal lives, or the mountain becomes our normal life.
If we stayed, the mountain would stop seeming special and start to feel mundane.
(How many people see less of their home than tourists, because it doesn't seem remarkable to them?)

The mountaintop is a place to escape from our lives, yes, but also a place to learn and grow.
We come back down, and we bring the changes with us.
We use our experience on the mountaintop to find ways to make our normal life better.

We had an amazing moment, and eventually it's over, and that's sad.
What comes next is focusing on the lessons we learned, the friendships we created, the experiences we had – and how we make those part of our lives, and use them to become a better person.

    This was a metaphorical mountaintop moment, if not a literal one.
    I’ve visited Slovenia twice, and it’s such a beautiful and peaceful place that I’m always charmed and rested by its vibes.

Before COVID, I was a regular attendee at PyCon UK, and those events were always a mountaintop moment for me.
I got to spend a week in Cardiff, hang out with friends I only saw once a year, and learn cool stuff about Python.
It was great fun, but I was always worn out and emotionally drained by the end of the final day.

PyCon UK 2017 ended on October 30th, and just a day earlier Ash McAllan [tweeted a thread][twitter] about "mountaintop experiences".
She was talking about a completely different conference, but it was the same pattern -- a big and exciting event, followed by an emotional crash.

When I read the thread, I felt an instant resonance: it was how I was feeling.
The idea stuck in my brain, and I've thought about it regularly ever since.
Whenever i have an emotional slump after a big event, I remind myself that I've just had a mountaintop moment -- and ask what I want to do next.

I've also shared it with friends when they're in a tricky spot, and I'd like to think it's helped at least a few of them.

I've been retelling this idea for a long time, and it feels like time to write it in my own words.
I also wanted to share some reflections on what mountaintop moments have meant for me.

* "mountaintop experience" to "mountaintop moment"

    Mountaintop moments don’t have to involve literal mountains, but sometimes they do.
    This is a photo taken at the top of the Uetliberg, at the end of a trip to Zurich to see my friends Rae and David.
    Fun fact: it was Rae who send me a link to Ash's Twitter thread back in 2017.
