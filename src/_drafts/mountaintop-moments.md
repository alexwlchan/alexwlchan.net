I'm in an emotional slump this week.
I've just done back-to-back trips to Vermont and the Edinburgh Fringe, and I'm exhausted.
It was fun -- I got to meet new people, hang out with some Internet friends in-person, and see some great theatre -- but now I'm worn out.
I'm glad to be home and getting some rest, but part of me also wishes I could go back.

This is a pretty common pattern: I do something exciting, it tires me out and I want to go home, but when I'm home I'm sad that the exciting thing is over.

I call events like these **mountaintop moments**.
They may not involve a literal mountain, but they're any event or experience where we can temporarily step away from our normal lives.
For me, they include conferences, holidays to new places, and days out with friends.

Being on the mountain means putting aside some of the routine of our daily lives.
With a bit of room to think and breathe, we can enjoy the view.
The air is cleaner, the sky and stars get closer, the world stretches out in front of us.
The mountaintop is larger than life.

The break in routine gives us space to grow.
We have new adventures, we discover new ideas, we meet new friends -- and we learn more about ourselves.

These intense, emotional events change us in ways we can't predict.
But exciting as they are, we eventually have to come down from the mountain, and it hurts.
All the energy and emotion is drained away as we return to our regular lives.

After a mountaintop moment, normal life can feel dull and subdued.
I always feel a sense of melancholy after a big event, and it takes me a few days to readjust.
I'm glad to return to the familiarity of my routine, and to have the opportunity to rest -- but I remember the emotional high, and nothing in my day-to-day can match it.

In the immediate aftermath, it's tempting to wonder if we can stay on the mountain.
What if we didn’t come down?
What if we made this our life?

But that’s not the point of the mountain -- we have to come down and return to our normal lives, or the mountain *becomes* our normal life.
If we stayed, the mountain would stop seeming special and start to become mundane.
(How many people see less of their home than tourists, because it doesn't seem remarkable to them?)

The mountaintop is a place to escape from our lives, yes, but also a place to learn and grow.
We come back down, and we bring the changes with us.
We use our experience on the mountaintop to find ways to make our normal life better.

We had an amazing moment, and eventually it's over, and that's sad.
What comes next is focusing on the lessons we learned, the friendships we created, the experiences we had – and how we make those part of our lives, and use them to become a better person.
