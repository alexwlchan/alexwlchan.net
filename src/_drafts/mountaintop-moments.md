Last weekend, I was in Edinburgh for the Fringe, and I'm so glad I went.
I met new people, hung out with some Internet friends in-person, and saw some great theatre.
It was fun, but also exhausting.
By the final day, I was worn out and ready to sleep in my own bed -- but now I'm home, I feel a bit sad to have left it all behind.
I've had a deliberately quiet week -- partly to rest, partly to give those happy memories time to sink in.

This happens to me a lot: I do something exciting, it tires me out and I want to go home.
But once I'm back, I miss the excitement and I'm sad that it's over.

I call events like these **mountaintop moments**.
They're any event or experience that lets us escape from our normal lives.
Atop the metaphorical mountain, the air is cleaner, the sky and stars get closer, and the view stretches out in front of us.
Given a temporary break from our usual routine, the world seems larger and more intense.

Being on the mountaintop gives us space to grow, and we can't help but be changed by the experience.
We have new adventures, we discover new ideas, we meet new friends -- and we learn more about ourselves.
We *need* these sorts of transformative event in our lives.

But exciting as they are, eventually we have to come down from the mountain, and that hurts.
All the energy and emotion is drained away as we return to our regular lives.

After a mountaintop moment, normal life can feel dull and subdued.
I always feel a bit miserable after a big event, and it takes me a few days to readjust.
I'm glad to return to the familiarity of my routine, and have a chance to rest -- but I remember the emotional high, and that's hard to match in my day-to-day.

In the immediate aftermath, it's tempting to wonder if we can stay on the mountain.
What if we didn't come down?
What if we made this our life?

But we can't stay there -- if we want them to be intense, transformative, elevated experiences, they have to be set apart from our daily lives.
If we stay on the top of the mountain, it stops being a mountaintop to us.
It would stop feeling special, and start to feel mundane.
(How many people see less of their home than tourists, because it doesn't seem remarkable to them?)

The point of the mountaintop is that we come back down.
It's a place to escape from our lives, yes, but it's also a place to learn and grow.
We come down, and we bring everything we learnt with us.
We need to use our experience on the mountaintop to find ways to make our normal life better.
Otherwise, what was the point of going up there?

We had an amazing moment, and eventually it's over, and that's sad.
What comes next is focusing on the lessons we learned, the friendships we built, the experiences we had – and how we bring those into our lives, and use them to become a better person.

    This was a metaphorical mountaintop moment, even if I didn't climb high enough to make it a literal one.
    I’ve visited Slovenia twice, and it’s such a beautiful and peaceful place that I’m always charmed and rested by its vibes.

Before COVID, I was a regular attendee at PyCon UK, and those events were always a mountaintop moment.
I got to spend a week in Cardiff, hang out with friends I only saw once a year, and learn cool stuff about Python.
It was great fun, but I was always worn out by the end of the final day.

PyCon UK 2017 ended on October 30th, and that same week Ash McAllan [tweeted a thread][twitter] about "mountaintop experiences".
She was talking about a completely different conference, but it was the same pattern -- a big and exciting event, followed by an emotional crash.

When I read her thread, there was an instant resonance -- I was having the feelings that she described.
She talked about post-conference depression, and invited us to consider how we can grow from this sort of experience:

> You go to the mountaintop to escape your life and to change.
> If you don't go back down, and take that change, that growth, that development, those opportunities with you, what was the point?

This framing stuck in my brain, and I still think about it regularly.

Before I read this thread, I'd wallow in sadness after a big event, and wait for the memories to fade.
Now, I still let myself grieve for the thing that's over -- but I also ask myself what I want to change in my life, and what I want to learn from those feelings.

This week I'm sad that I'm no longer in Edinburgh, because there were more shows I wanted to see.
(I think everyone who goes to Fringe feels that.)
While I was there, I saw several plays that dealt with heavy topics like heartbreak and grief.
They left me really emotional, and in three days I sobbed my way through a whole packet of tissues.

I love that sort of theatre, and it makes me want to write something that makes people *feel* things.
That's a change from the technical prose I usually write -- which is meant to be informative, not evocative.
Writing about feelings and emotions is daunting, which is why I keep shying away from it.
I'm only going to get better if I practice, and that's part of why I'm writing this article.

I want to describe the feeling of mountaintop moments my own words, and reflect on what they’ve meant to me.
I've shared this idea with friends when they're struggling with post-event blues, and I'd like to think it's helped at least a few of them.
I hope it can help you too.

To round out this piece, I wanted to talk about a few of the things I've learnt from mountaintop moments.
I've spotted some patterns that probably aren't unique to me.

---

**Mountaintop moments help me spot habits I should try to kick.**
Whenever I go on a trip, I'm more intentional about how I spend my time -- I'm trying to make good use of the limited time I have in a new place.
This means I end up dropping a lot of my routines, and not all of them need to come back when I'm home.

For example, I've wasted a lot of time with screens, mindlessly scrolling on social media.
I don't do any of that when I go away, because it feels like a poor use of my time.
I still use my technology, but in a more pragmatic way -- for example, in Edinburgh, I opened Discord to arrange to meet friends, then closed it as soon as we agreed a time and place.

I'm trying to be more intentional about how I use digital technology, and the times when I go without it have definitely helped.
I go away for a week, I stop looking at social media, and nothing bad happens.
Do that enough times, and the message sinks in.

I have a complicated relationship with technology, and I'm still struggling to find the right balance.
Whenever I go away, I'm reminded of how nice it feels not to fritter away my time, and it motivates me to keep trying to find a better balance in my daily life.

**Mountaintop moments show me how I want to spend my time.**
A break from routine is a good time to try new things.
Some of those I'll be glad to leave as a one-off; others I realise

I'm a software developer, and most of my work is digital.
It's ephemeral and lacks any tangible representation.
When I step away from my desk for an extended period, 

2/ more time doing things in the world i’m a professional software dev and most of my work is digital, ephemeral essentially disappears when i step away from my desk

want to do more things that actually manifest in the physical world could be making things, e.g. handcrafts or other actions that improve something in the world recently visited a dear friend and helped moved a few wardrobes, and that felt so good more exciting than a lot of work i do

, and it's the first thing to go when I go on a trip -- when I'm being more conscious of how I spend my time, and I don't want to waste the time I have in the new place.
I stop looking at social media, tinkering with my computer, mindlessly scrolling.
When I come back from a mountaintop moment, I always try to avoid falling back into bad habits

I have a complicated relationship with computers, and they're not wholly good or wholly bad.

1/ more intentional use on digital technology, less time wasting i spend so much time looking at screens, and it’s the first thing to go when i go on a trip i stop looking at social media, tinkering with my computer, mindlessly scrolling i have a complicated relationship with these things, and trying to disentangle – whats helping me and what’s habit

not going to pretend this is easy, and i still have a long way to go on two recent trips i tried to eschew tech as much as I could, and I think moderate success trying not to fall back into hold habits when i return

**Mountaintop moments help me spot stuff I can get rid of.**
There's always clutter in my life -- stuff that was useful once, but now it's stuck around because of inertia rather than because I still need it.
The break in my routine forces me to do without those things, and makes it easier to spot 

The break in my routine forces me to do without a lot of my things -- both physical objects and

I always find physical and habitual clutter -- stuff that's stuck around because of inertia, rather than because I still need it.
It may have been useful once, but no longer.
The break in my routine forces me to do without those things, and I don't pick them back up on my return.

For me, the return from a mountaintop moments is when I usually find things to cut out of my life.
This includes physical possessions and 

stuff that's stuck around because of inertia, rather than 

my mountaintop moments usually occur after time spent away from home
could be a week of holiday or just a long day trip
I break from my routine, and I see what's working and what's not
what am I doing because it's important, what because it's what I've always done
whenever i return from the mountain, i always find things to cut out of my life, stuff that's stuck around from inertia -- both physical clutter and habitual clutter

always find myself clinging to the moment, trying to hold on to it
recently saw an amazing play, gave me so many feelings
tried to avoid anything that would give me strong feelings, so I can hold onto it for a bit longer

whenever i come back from a "mountaintop moment" can be a tricky time
i'm emotionally drained, bad time to make decisions!
but also want to take advantage of the intense feelings to make changes to improve my life

three emergent themes

1/ more intentional use on digital technology, less time wasting
i spend so much time looking at screens, and it's the first thing to go when i go on a trip
i stop looking at social media, tinkering with my computer, mindlessly scrolling
i have a complicated relationship with these things, and trying to disentangle -- whats helping me and what's habit

not going to pretend this is easy, and i still have a long way to go
on two recent trips i tried to eschew tech as much as I could, and I think moderate success
trying not to fall back into hold habits when i return

2/ more time doing things in the world
i'm a professional software dev and most of my work is digital, ephemeral
essentially disappears when i step away from my desk

want to do more things that actually manifest in the physical world
could be making things, e.g. handcrafts
or other actions that improve something in the world
recently visited a dear friend and helped moved a few wardrobes, and that felt so good
more exciting than a lot of work i do

3/ more time spent with people I care about
friendship is a precious thing, and wilts if not actively tended
i am always delighted to spend time with people, but not good at setting it up

going on trips when I get to spend time with people is always such a wonderful experience
company of a friend can transform an otherwise unremarkable day into a wonderful memory
and makes me want to do it more
again this is hard and I can do a lot better here
i know what i need to do, just need to do it

these same themes keep emerging because they're hard
because they're important
and because backsliding is easy
i think i can see small signs of progress, and have got better
but none of these are things I can take for granted, and need active management to remember these lessons, and not forget what I learned on the mountain
