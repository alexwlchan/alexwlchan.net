I'm in an emotional slump this week.
After back-to-back trips to Vermont and the Edinburgh Fringe, I'm exhausted.
They were good trips -- I got to meet new people, hang out with some Internet friends in-person, and see some great theatre -- but now I'm worn out.
I'm glad to be home and getting some rest, but part of me also wishes I could go back.

This is a pretty common pattern: I do something exciting, it tires me out and I want to go home, but when I'm home I'm sad that the exciting thing is over.

I call these **mountaintop moments**.
They may not involve a literal mountain, but they're any event or experience where we can temporarily step away from our normal lives.

We climb the mountain to escape our normal lives. The air is cleaner, the stars are closer, the view stretches further. The world feels bigger when we’re atop our metaphorical mountain. These are intense, exciting, transformational experiences.

We can’t help but be changed by the mountaintop. We’re filled with a sense of wonder and connection. We learn new things, meet new friends, have new experiences. Climbing the mountain helps us to learn, to grow, and to become better people. We need these moments in our lives.

Then we come down from the mountain, and that hurts. We’ve had an intense and amazing experience, and now we have to leave it behind. All the energy and emotion is drained away as we return to our normal lives.

After being on the mountain, normal life can feel dull and subdued. I always feel sad and melancholy after a big event, and it takes me a few days to readjust to my normal life. In the immediate aftermath, it’s tempting to wonder if we can stay up the mountain. What if we didn’t come down? What if we made this our life?

But that’s not the point of the mountain – we have to come down and return to our normal lives, or the mountain *becomes* our normal life. It stops seeming special and starts to become mundane. (How many people see less of their home than tourists, because it doesn’t seem remarkable to them?)

We climb the mountain to escape our lives, yes, but also to learn and to grow. We come back down, and we bring those changes with us. We use our experience on the mountaintop to find ways to make our normal life better.

We had an amazing moment, and that’s gone now, and that sucks. The important thing is to focus on the lessons we learned, the friendships we created, the experiences we had – and how we make those part of our lives, and use them to become a better person.
