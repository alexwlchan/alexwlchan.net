This is a talk I gave this morning as the opening keynote of [PyCon UK 2018][pyconuk].

I was already planning to do a talk about online harassment, and Daniele (the conference director) encouraged me to expand the idea, and turn it into a talk about positive behaviour.
This is my abstract:

> In 2018, trust is at a low.
> Over the past several decades, trust has declined – fewer and fewer people trust each other, and the reputation of big institutions (government, media, politicians, even non-profits) is in tatters.
>
> What happened?
>
> In this talk, I’ll explain how the design of certain systems have been exploited for abuse, and this has corroded our trust – and conversely, how we can build environments that encourage and sustain good behaviour.

The talk was recorded, and thanks to the wizardry of Tim&nbsp;V-G, it's already been posted on YouTube:

Note: these are the notes of what I intended to say, but there was a lot of ad libbing.
This doesn't include everything I said, but I hope it's a useful starting point.
