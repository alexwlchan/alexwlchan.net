I read 75 books this year, which is slightly up on previous years ([2022]({% post_url 2022/2022-12-31-2022-in-reading %}), [2021]({% post_url 2021/2021-12-31-2021-in-reading %})).
I’m pleased with that number, although overall I found it a slightly disappointing year for reading.
Although I read more books, there were less books that I really loved – the sort of book that changes my view on the world, that I’m still thinking about weeks later.

I did return to a couple of favourite authors, who all had new books that I enjoyed – Alexandria Bellefleur, Toshikazu Kawaguchi, Maureen Johnson – but that was more familiar than new.
I got more of my novelty from theatre than books this year.

About half of what I read came from my local library.
This was particularly helpful for the “good, but not great” books that I know I won’t read again.
I was glad to return them to the library, and not have them taking up space in my house.

I continue to write short reviews of books I’ve read at <https://books.alexwlchan.net>, and keep notes in Obsidian.
The latter have been useful for jogging my memory, including as I write this post.

These are the best books I read in 2023, in the order I read them:

      This is a fascinating, if heavy, take on the “what if” concept.
    </p>
    <p>
      Iris has run away from the forest to escape her abusive wife, and there she meets an alternate version of herself who made different choices.
      They both have regrets about how their life turned out, and envy towards some aspects of the other’s life – but they also come to learn that the grass isn’t always greener.
      One life isn’t inherently better than the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book switches back and forth between “Before” (the events leading up to her running away) and “After” (what she does in the woods).
      You know that something bad has happened to Iris, but you only find out the details slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It gave me a lot of thoughts and feelings, and I felt a lot of sympathy for Iris.
      Both Irises have flawed and imperfect lives, and there’s no implied moral that one is obviously better or more correct.
      I haven’t read it again, but I want to, because I suspect there’s a lot I’d pick up on a second time round.

      This is an account of abuse, neglect, and deaths of Indigenous students in Canada’s school systems.
      It’s not an easy book to read, but it’s well-written and worth the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It focuses on seven deaths in Thunder Bay, and includes the history of the residential schools which form the backdrop for those events.
      As I don’t know much about Canadian history or education, I found the context useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The titular “Seven Fallen Feathers” are seven children who died in unexplained circumstances.
      The book devotes a chapter to each of them, describing their history, the days leading up to their death, and the hole it created in the lives of friends and family left behind.
      It's difficult to read but important, and the author has obviously done a lot of research and interviews.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are certain themes that keep coming up – racism towards Indigenous people, disinterest from the Thunder Bay police, the effect of moving kids to big cities – but the author is almost subtle about them.
      She doesn’t need to tell you what patterns you should be looking for, because it’s so obvious from the stories.
      It’s the embodiment of “show, don’t tell”.
