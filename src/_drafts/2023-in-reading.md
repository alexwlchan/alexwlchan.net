I read 75 books this year, which is slightly up on last year.
I’m pleased with that number, although overall I found it a slightly disappointing year for reading.
Although I read more books, there were less books that I really loved – the sort of book that changes my view on the world, that I’m still thinking about weeks later.

I did return to a couple of favourite authors, who all had new books that I enjoyed – Alexandria Bellefleur, Toshikazu Kawaguchi, Maureen Johnson – but that was more familiar than new. I think I got more of my novelty from theatre than books this year.

About half of what I read came from my local library. This was particularly helpful for the “good, but not great” books that I know I won’t read again. I was glad to return them to the library, and have them taking up space in my house.

I continue to write short reviews of books I’ve read at <https://books.alexwlchan.net>, and keep notes in Obsidian.
The latter have been useful for jogging my memory, including as I write this post.

These are the best books I read in 2023, in the order I read them:
