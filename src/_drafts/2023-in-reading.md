I read 75 books this year, which is slightly up on previous years ([2022]({% post_url 2022/2022-12-31-2022-in-reading %}), [2021]({% post_url 2021/2021-12-31-2021-in-reading %})).
I’m pleased with that number, although overall I found it a slightly disappointing year for reading.
Although I read more books, there were less books that I really loved – the sort of book that changes my view on the world, that I’m still thinking about weeks later.

I did return to a couple of favourite authors, who all had new books that I enjoyed – Alexandria Bellefleur, Toshikazu Kawaguchi, Maureen Johnson – but that was more familiar than new.
I got more of my novelty from theatre than books this year.

About half of what I read came from my local library.
This was particularly helpful for the “good, but not great” books that I know I won’t read again.
I was glad to return them to the library, and not have them taking up space in my house.

I continue to write short reviews of books I’ve read at <https://books.alexwlchan.net>, and keep notes in Obsidian.
The latter have been useful for jogging my memory, including as I write this post.

Below are the best books I read in 2023, in the order I read them.
Note that it's quite a heavy selection, several dealing with death and oppression and other unpleasant things.
I do recommend them all, but you should have a cheery book to read afterwards.

This is a fascinating, if heavy, take on the “what if” concept.

Iris has run away from the forest to escape her abusive wife, and there she meets an alternate version of herself who made different choices.
They both have regrets about how their life turned out, and envy towards some aspects of the other’s life – but they also come to learn that the grass isn’t always greener.
One life isn’t inherently better than the other.

The book switches back and forth between “Before” (the events leading up to her running away) and “After” (what she does in the woods).
You know that something bad has happened to Iris, but you only find out the details slowly.

It gave me a lot of thoughts and feelings, and I felt sympathy for Iris.
Both Irises have flawed and imperfect lives, and there’s no implied moral that one is obviously better or more correct.
I haven’t read it again, but I want to, because I suspect there’s a lot I’d pick up on a second time round.

(Yes, I technically read this in 2022, but it missed the cutoff for last year’s post.)

This is an account of abuse, neglect, and deaths of Indigenous students in Canada’s school systems.
It’s not an easy book to read, but it’s well-written and worth the time.

It focuses on seven deaths in Thunder Bay, and includes the history of the residential schools which form the backdrop for those events.
As I don’t know much about Canadian history or education, I found the context useful.

The titular “Seven Fallen Feathers” are seven children who died in unexplained circumstances.
The book devotes a chapter to each of them, describing their history, the days leading up to their death, and the hole it created in the lives of friends and family left behind.
It's difficult to read but important, and the author has obviously done a lot of research and interviews.

There are certain themes that keep coming up – racism towards Indigenous people, disinterest from the Thunder Bay police, the effect of moving kids to big cities – but the author is almost subtle about them.
She doesn’t need to tell you what patterns you should be looking for, because it’s so obvious from the stories.
It’s the embodiment of “show, don’t tell”.

Content warnings for death, suicide, racism and colonialism.

A fun story in an America in which fantasy and magic are real and somewhat commonplace, including vampires, ghosts, and evil scarecrows.

Elatsoe (“Ellie”) is a member of the Lipan tribe, and women in her family have the ability to speak to ghosts – usually animal ghosts, because human ghosts are more violent and angry.
She’s investigating the death of her cousin, which she believes to be a murder.

The plot is a little slow, but the worldbuilding is gorgeous – it feels rich and real, without being heavy-handed.
We get little glimpses, but it’s never treated as spectacular or obsessed over.
I didn’t need to have every detail to enjoy it.
I’d happily read more stories in this setting, but it also works nicely as a standalone.

I read Darcie Little Badger’s second book in August.
<em>A Snake Falls to Earth</em> is another good fantasy, and adds her to my list of favourite authors.

This is a gorgeous story about grief and heartbreak, and two people learning to find love again after great tragedy.

The phone box itself is almost mundane, with no special magic or power. When I first saw the title, I wondered if this was a fantasy or sci-fi book – I was getting strong TARDIS vibes – but it’s not, and that’s a good thing.
Instead, we see very little of the conversations people have inside the phone box, which are largely private.

The book only revolves around a handful of characters – Yui, Takeshi, and Hana. Although we see other people who visit the phone box, we only see them through their eyes. Focusing on just a few characters is a smart move, because it lets us see more of their lives and their feelings.

It reminded me a lot of Toshikazu Kawaguchi’s books, which I adore – grief and sadness but with an ultimately positive message.

This was a great memoir about autism and sexuality.

I first saw Fern Brady when she appeared on <em>Taskmaster</em>, where she quickly became one of my favourite contestants.
I loved how unapologetic she was about being herself, and how much fun she seemed to be having.
When I learnt she was writing a memoir, I knew I had to read it.

It’s the story of her life, being autistic, and the ways her behaviours have affected her life.
It felt genuine and raw, and it wasn’t unrealistically hopeful or optimistic – it was a statement about how autism has affected her life.
Her experience isn’t the same as mine, but I definitely saw parallels with my own experiences.

I was engrossed and read it in a single day; I was enjoying it so much I actually missed my train stop on the way home.

This is a gripping and horrifying story of growing up in North Korea, then escaping as an adult.

North Korea is a country I was only vaguely aware of, and most of my knowledge comes from pop culture stereotypes, so I learnt a lot from this book.
It starts when Jihyun was a child, in the early 1970s, and North Korea was less uncomfortable, if not exactly prosperous.
My mental image of the country is entirely the modern regime, so it was good to read more about its history, and witness the decline through Jihyun's life.
It was as unpleasant as it was fascinating.

As the book describes inhumane atrocities, the writing is clear and simple, with plenty of detail.
As with *Seven Fallen Feathers*, this is a good example of "show, don't tell".

The overall narrative is strong, but it's also full of small details and individual stories, which is the sort of thing I enjoy in memoirs.
