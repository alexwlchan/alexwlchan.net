split the site into articles/til
  - articles are long-form stuff
  - til are shorter posts, meant primarily for google
  - have separate pages and RSS feeds
  - this is a popular idea, but that alone isn't reason to do it
  - rest of post: why?

## melankorin: what's your content model?

doing default content model, works well enough

how to make better?
first have to ask:

## what's audience of this site?

  - bit late to ask, better late than never
  - 1/ me
      - initially no visitors
      - writing to practice
      - posting online gave sense of accountability
  - 2/ casual searchers
      - looking in google for answer to specific problem
      - my posts do well here
      - land on site, read one post, go away
      - looking for something quick and easy
      - v unlikely to look around
  - 3/ dedicated readers
      - friends, family, colleagues
      - know who I am and want to read stuff I've written
      - not looking for specific info

how am I doing?
  1/ I'm fine
  2/ site works well
  3/ not convinced it works well -- content is too variable
  
## better content model!

TILs
  - these are for casual searchers
  - typically explain one thing
  - solve specific problem in particular circumstances
  - v descriptive titles => good in google
  - great if you have problem, boring if everything else
  - pretty quick to write, can often write in an hour or so

articles
  - these are for dedicated readers
  - longer prose, take more time
  - more engaging for readers, broader appeal
  - but harder to write! no hook
  - but this is what I want to write more of
  
previously had them shoved into one bucket, neither was good

splitting them out = many advantages

TILs
  - can be short, to the point
  - no attempts at lyrical prose
  - no pretence that will be read by anybody who isn't coming from google
  - shorter, tighter, better for those readers

articles
  - can be longer, more spaced-out
  - homepage only features articles, easier to find
  - easier for dedicated readers to find articles
  - no longer drowned out by TIL posts

can also blend them with the magic of ~hyperlinks~
e.g screenshots

this is content modelling 101, but took me long time to realise
(even watching people write content models for other webistes)
but I got there in the end

meta-goal for this site has been testing ground for new ideas and approaches
writing, programming, and now content design

I actually started doing this in January, but I’m only talking about it now
bad habit of having great ideas that don't last
In previous attempts, I’ve shoved them on site domains or side blogs and quickly withered and died

I’ve already written 54 TIL posts this year (about one every two days)
This feels like it’s going to stick

still a few rough edges, e.g. tags
how do I show same tag across both post types. do I need to?


I don’t want to pretend that splitting out TILd into their own section 
Is some sort of miracle cure, But I do think it solves a bunch of My low-grade frustrations about the site
Maybe it’s just confirmation bias, but this change feels right
