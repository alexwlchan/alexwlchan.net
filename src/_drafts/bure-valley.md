Last October, I took a day trip to the [Bure Valley Railway][bvrw], a narrow-gauge heritage railway in north Norfolk.
I came across it quite by chance -- I was driving through Aylsham to get to my B&B, and I happened to see a sign pointing to the railway.
I checked the website for a timetable, bought myself a ticket, and I went for a day of steam trains.

I had a lovely day, and this post has a few of my photos.

It's hard to get a sense of scale from the pictures, but these are all narrow-gauge engines, much smaller than mainline locomotives.
If an adult stands next to them, they'll look down into the cab.

I arrived pretty early, so I saw the engines being wheeled out of the depot -- on this particular day, the black *John of Gaunt* and the dark blue *Blickling Hall* were both pulling trains.
Despite looking impeccable to my eye, they were still getting polishing and touch-ups from the volunteers.

As they were setting up, one of the drivers explained how the engines they're using are stored during the winter.
Their fires are left burning overnight, rather than being extinguished and re-lit each day.
This reduces stress on the mechanical components -- repeated up-and-down temperature changes would do more damage than keeping them warm.

I started the day at Aylsham, which has both passenger platforms and an engine shed.
The carriages themselves are pretty short (presumably to lower the centre of gravity?) but with a minimal step and several wheelchair spaces.

Two engines are visible -- a dark blue engine and a light blue engine. To the left-hand side you can see the carriages with doors open, and passengers milling around and ready to board.">
    </a>
  </div>
</figure>

The line runs from Aylsham to Wroxham, and it's a 45 minute trip -- a proper railway, not just a garden train set.
That gave me plenty of time to sit back and enjoy the Norfolk countryside.
(I didn't take many pictures of the scenery, so you'll just have to take my word for it that it's pretty.)

  </a>
</figure>

The carriages were quite comfortable, and I had a compartment all to myself.
In what's become a bit of a habit, my outfit was a pretty close match to the seat covers.
A close friend has described this as "[my] author photo", which feels distressingly accurate.

</figure>

I got out at Wroxham for a brief wander.
I don't have any strong memories of the village, but I was able to get some lunch and wander into a few shops.
I was in a distinctly new place -- the train had taken me *somewhere*, which is what trains are meant to do.

At some point it started raining, so I retreated to the cover of the station, where I got to see the engines being prepped for the return journey.
First the drivers topped up the water tanks, then they drove the engines onto a turntable.
They had to turn them by hand (which looked like quite a workout!), and then they were facing the opposite journey, ready to pull the return journey.

In these pictures you can see the drivers standing next to the trains, so hopefully you get a better sense of scale:

    </a>
  </div>
</figure>

Adding to the sense that the Bure Valley Railway is a transport link and not just a museum piece, the Wroxham terminus is right next to the mainline [Hoveton & Wroxham station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoveton_%26_Wroxham_railway_station).
You can walk between the stations, and full-size trains pass on the other side of the fence.
Of course, the drivers whistle at each other as they pass.

This let me get two of my favourite pictures of the day -- trains from both lines in the same shot.

First is this photo of *Blickling Hall* with a [Stadler FLIRT train][flirt] (a name which I enjoy for somebody's commitment to a bit; it's the same acronym in both English and German):

<figure class="wide_img rounded_corners">
  <a href="/images/2022/IMG_5958.jpg">
    <img src="/images/2022/IMG_5958_1x.jpg" srcset="/images/2022/IMG_5958_1x.jpg 1x, /images/2022/IMG_5958_2x.jpg 2x">
  </a>
</figure>

Second is this profile shot of *Blickling Hall* with a Class 37 diesel, which was pulling a series of tank wagons.
I love the contrast of the grimy diesel with the polished steamie:

<figure class="wide_img rounded_corners">
  <a href="/images/2022/IMG_5934.jpg">
    <img src="/images/2022/IMG_5934_1x.jpg" srcset="/images/2022/IMG_5934_1x.jpg 1x, /images/2022/IMG_5934_2x.jpg 2x">
  </a>
</figure>

They create a lot of steam!
My camera could cut through the haze, but in the last photo here, I literally couldn't see the engine through the fog (or anything else!).

There was a lot of steam coming from two tubes near the front of the engine, not through the main funnel.
I remember thinking that was odd on the day -- I did see steam coming out of the funnels, so they're not just decorative -- but I don't know enough about how steam engines work to know why steam comes out of two places.

Once I'd finished taking photos on Wroxham, I got back on the train for the return journey to Aylsham.
The weather had become thoroughly grey and rainy, so the scenery wasn't quite as pretty, but it was still a nice trip.

This Tuesday was actually the first day my employer had mandated a return to the office for their staff, and if I hadn't been on leave, I'd have been on a packed commuter service heading into central London.
Even with overcast skies, a steam train through Norfolk was a much better choice.

On the day, my only camera was my phone, and I'm decidedly not a pro photographer -- but I still enjoy taking a few "artsy" shots.

I enjoy seeing steam trains, and these were some particularly fine examples.
They were all in impeccable condition,

---

The line runs between Aylsham and Wroxham – trains do a 45 minute trip one way, then they hop on a (manual!) turntable and get flipped around for the return journey.

Steeeeeeeeeam.

The depot is at Aylsham, where I started my day. (It’s where the first train departs from, which is the clue.)

Interesting fact: the station at Wroxham is very close to the mainline railway station – so sometimes big trains pass by the little trains (and of course, they toot each other).

I’m legit pleased with these photos, which show big train and little train.

Church photo interlude for
@JayHulmePoet
: this is St Laurence in Ingworth, which I passed on the way home.

Regular straight lines right up to the curved bit on one end. Plain glass so light shines right through. Apparently dates from the mid 11th century (aka ‘young’).
A church on a large grassy bank set against a blue sky. The church is made of lots of small stones in the walls, with a fairly conventional triangular roof over most of the structure, but then a semi-circular section on the end with a conical thatched roof.

A profile view of the church, showing some of the large plain windows and the entrance way. The semi-circular section has a noticeably different roof to the rest of the church.

Looking out through the entrance hallway into the graveyard. The entrance is made of yellowish stone, and there’s a gravel path lined with green grass leading out to the wooden gate into the graveyard.

So. Many. Train. Photos.

If you were wondering how much of a day I can spend being gooey-eyed at steam engines? It’s a lot.

(I hope you all have things in your lives that make you as excited as I get about trains, and that you get to express that excitement. 💖)

I won’t share all my photos, but here is one detail: the trains have small brass plates for the name of their drivers. (I think; in my nervousness I actually forgot to ask for names. 😣)

Neal drove both of my trains, and he’s an absolute peach: https://twitter.com/alexwlchan/status/1447912588361277442…
A small brass plate with the name “Neal Cumming” in engraved letters, and in smaller text “Driver”. It’s mounted on a black train, and you can see me in the reflection.

“Your name’s not Anne, is it? You look just like someone I used to know.”

“Sorry, no.”

(But I am delighted to be gendered in a way that makes that plausible. I’m having a blast of a day, if you couldn’t tell. 🥰)

There’s a couple at the train station I’m at who both seem to be having the most lovely day out with other, and it’s so incredibly pure and I cannot. My heart has grown two sizes and I’d forgotten much I enjoy seeing other people be happy. 🥰

[Anti anti-wholesomeness: I was braced for people to be weird today, because I was travelling alone, and “girls aren’t interested in trains” or similar nonsense.

It was fine! I wasn’t patronised, nobody was sexist, no-one asked if I was with my boyfriend. A pleasant surprise.]

Ending with my favourite photo.

I had a wonderful day out at
@BureValley
. Beautiful engines, gorgeous scenery, lovely volunteers. 🥰

11/10, would ride there again.

(Friends who also love trains: who fancies a trip?)
Another selfie! I’m a bit dishevelled, my hair is ruffled, and my hands are full of stuff. I’m standing in front of the station canopy, and I’m beaming. Huge smile.
