I've been using [Jekyll] to build this blog for about two and a half years.
Because the site is quite simple, I've had plenty of time to work on the long tail of small details: stuff that makes me smile, but won't necessarily be apparent to anyone else.
This post is about one of those details.

Most people will notice that the site works well on small screens as well as big.
Lots of web traffic comes from smartphones, so I made sure the design would scale up as well as down.

One of the projects I've been working on recently is the [website for PyCon UK 2020][pyconuk].
Because I'm responsible for the site this year, we're using a static site created with [Jekyll], the same tool I use to create this blog.
One of the nice things about using Jekyll is that I can reuse a lot of the tooling from this blog
