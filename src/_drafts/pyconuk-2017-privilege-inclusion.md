When I go to tech conferences, I'm often drawn to the non-technical talks.
Talks about diversity, or management, or culture.
So when it came to make a proposal for this year's PyCon UK, I wanted to see if I could write my own non-technical talk.

Talking

This is a talk I gave at PyCon UK 2017.
You can read the slides and notes on this page, or download the slides [as a PDF](/slides/privilege_inclusion/privilege_inclusion_slides.pdf).
The official video isn't up yet, but I'll post a link here when it's done.

You can also [skip to the end](#notes) for some notes.
