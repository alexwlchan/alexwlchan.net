I semi-regularly do a braindump of my ideas for running inclusive conferences, and I finally realised it would be useful to have it all written up in one place.
Last week, I had a meeting with [Lauren Couch][lauren], the head of Diversity and Inclusion at Wellcome, and she was kind enough to lend me the notes she wrote -- this is the tidied-up summary.

For better or for worse, conferences can be really important for career development.
Sharing ideas, having conversations, meeting new people -- if you can't attend conferences, you miss out on a lot of these ooportunities.
It's important to open these events to as wide a range as people as possible.
It addresses a serious unfairness, and everyone benefits from having a wider diversity of people and ideas.

This is mostly based on my experience with small, community conferences in the UK tech industry.
Underrepresented groups in tech include women, people with disabilities, people on low income, people who don't have European or US citizenship -- and the suggestions reflect that.

None of these are original ideas -- this is a collection of ideas I've seen at conferences I've attended or followed online.

If you're an event organiser, you can take these ideas to make your events more inclusive and accessible.

If you attend, speak at, or sponsor an event, you have power -- you can demand these accommodations where they don't already exist.
Be picky about where you choose to participate, and walk away from events that don't meet your standards.

<!-- summary -->

*Disclaimer:* I've helped organise [PyCon UK][pyconuk] for the last two years, and there's heavy reference to it below -- but most of these ideas predate my involvement.

## Have a code of conduct

A code of conduct sets the expectation and rules for your event.
It tells people what sort of behaviour is acceptable, and how violations will be dealt with.
This shows potential attendees that they should feel safe at your event, and if harassment or bullying does occur, it gives them a recourse.

A code of conduct is only as good as its enforcement -- so you have to follow through with it.

Don't be shy about calling out problems if they occur.
At PyCon UK in 2016, if a CoC violation occurred, three things would happen:

*   Somebody would tweet about it from the conference Twitter account
*   The problem would be mentioned in the opening remarks the following day, with an explanation of what happened and how it was resolved
*   After the conference, there was a [code of conduct report][report] that explained the two issues

This helps people see that you're enforcing the CoC (and hopefully makes them feel more comfortable making a report, if they need to).
It also serves as a counterpoint to people who say "this sort of behaviour doesn't happen in our community" -- unfortunately, it almost certainly does.

*See also:*

*   Ashe Dryden has written a [very thorough Codes of Conduct 101 and FAQ][dryden], which I highly recommend.
    It has much more detail about what makes a good CoC, and answers common questions and objections.

## Venue spaces

### Offer gender-neutral bathrooms

At tech conferences I've been to, there are lots of trans and non-binary people, who are often excluded or marginalised by gendered toilets.
Modifying your venue to have some gender-neutral bathrooms is a nice way to make them feel included.

When AlterConf was still running, it was a staple of the conference tweets to see somebody take a photo of the gender-neutral bathroom signs (this is in Berlin):

{% tweet https://twitter.com/iamkimiam/status/848188958567800832 %}

If it's not possible (for example, you're sharing your conference space), remind your attendees not to challenge somebody else's choice of bathroom.
For example, here's a sign from one of the Write The Docs conferences:

> If you're using this restroom and you think a person's gender doesn't match the sign on the door, follow these steps:
>
> Don't worry about it, they know better than you.

Personally, I feel the ideal is a mixture of gender-neutral and gendered bathrooms.
I know enough women who are concerned about the loss of women-only bathrooms that I think it's valuable to offer alongside gender-neutral bathrooms, if possible -- but that depends on the size of your venue.

(I've done a bunch of thinking around gender-neutral and accessible bathrooms for a work project recently; I may write another post about it later.)

### Provide baskets of free toiletries

I first heard of this idea [from Write The Docs][wtd_bathroom], who were inspired by DjangoCon Europe.
Here's an excerpt from [DjangoCon's sponsor brochure][sponsor]:

> **Bathroom basket sponsor** <br/>
> We'll provide baskets with basic medical, sanitary and similar supplies for free at the conference bathrooms.

This ensures that if somebody is caught out in the middle of the day, they don't need to go far for help -- or miss much of the conference.

If you're doing this, remember to put the same products in all your bathrooms -- although the majority of people who get periods will probably use the women's bathrooms, there may be people who get periods using the men's and accessible bathrooms as well.

IANAL, but I wonder if there may be rules about providing medication at events, and in particular making it self-service.
Free sanitary products and spray-on deodorant are probably fine; you may want to check local rules about painkillers and the like.

### Quiet room

Give people a space to unwind and rest away from the business of the conference.

For people who get worn out from socialising and networking, this gives them a place to unwind and rest.
I wrote [about the quiet room at PyCon UK](/2016/09/silence-is-golden/) in 2016.

### Prayer room

Similar to the above, but specifically dedicated for prayer.

### clear signage

## Food and drink

### Be explicit about dietary requirements

If you're running a large event, you can anticipate common dietary requirements in advance:

*   Vegetarian
*   Vegan
*   Dairy-free
*   Gluten-free
*   Nut-free

If you know you'll be providing suitable food, say so in advance.
You should also ask about other requirements (ideally when somebody buys their ticket), and accommodate them if possible.

Make sure food is clearly labelled, both by category and ingredients.

For allergies like nut- and gluten-free, it's helpful to have details about the kitchen, if available.
(For example, *"This was prepared in a nut-free kitchen"* vs *"This wasn't prepared in a nut-free kitchen, but separate utensils and surfaces were used"*.
For some people, that difference matters.)

You may need to remind non-vegetarians not to eat all the vegetarian food, so the vegetarians don't go hungry!
Separate queues, or taking food orders in advance, can both help with this.

### Provide non-alcoholic and low-sugar drinks

If you're providing drinks, offer some non-alcoholic soft drinks.
Soft drinks are often high sugar (juices and sodas).
Low-sugar drinks (e.g. flavoured waters) are also helpful.

REF???


## Venue spaces





## Parents/guardians with young children

Having young children can make conferences very difficult -- they require full-time care, which means you're either taking them around the conference (which means you may have to leave talks or conversations in a hurry), or you need somebody else to provide childcare.
Neither are easy or convenient.

### Run a crèche

At PyCon UK, we've run a free crèche for several years -- we hire a couple of people to look after young children, and parents just have to tell us with a bit of notice before the conference starts.
The crèche has a dedicated room, away from the main conference.

You can still take your kids to session, or see them between talks -- but if you need some time to focus on the conference, you've got that to.

### Nursing/baby care room

If you can't run a crèche, have a private space for nursing and breastfeeding.
In general, breastfeeding should be destigmatised and acceptable in all your conferences spaces -- but some people will prefer to do it in private.


## Support for disabilities

### Live captioning in talks

[[ picture ]]

Hire a stenographer to provide real-time captioning on talks, which can be displayed on screens alongside the speaker.
It helps people who are hard-of-hearing, and it's also a useful tool for your able-bodied attendees -- if their focus drifts, it's a way to catch up.

To support the captioners, ask speakers for specialist/technical terms in advance.
They can be programmed into the stenographer's keyboards, so you get more accurate transcriptions.

I first saw this [at PyCon UK 2016][sttr], but I've also seen it at AlterConf and Coed:Ethics, and heard of it at other conferences.

### Sign language interpreters

Similar to closed captioning -- sign language interpreters can help attendees who are hard-of-hearing.

This is less useful to a general audience, as most people aren't fluent in sign language.
At PyCon UK, we only provide BSL interpreters upon request (for free), whereas we always provide live captioning.

### Audio induction loop

??? HOW DOES THIS WORK

A lot of venues will have this (it's required by law in the UK), but it's good to check.

And remind your speakers to use the microphone, if available -- just because they can speak loudly, doesn't mean everyone can hear them.

### Fresh water, treats, and relief areas for service animals

This is a recent addition to the list -- I heard about it [from GitHub Universe][universe].

[universe]: https://blog.github.com/2018-08-02-github-universe-scholarship-program/

### Preferred seating for people with vision problems

I think I heard of this at AlterConf -- if you had vision problems and would struggle to see the slides from the back, there was reserved seating near the front where you'd have a good view of the screen.

### Provide detail about "wheelchair accessibility"

It's not enough to say a venue is "wheelchair accessible", because wheelchairs come in different shapes and sizes.
Provide detail such as:

*   Is there step-free access within the venue?
    Is it ramps, wheelchair lifts, or lifts?
    How big are the lifts?

*   How wide are the doorways?
    If the main venue is some way inside a building, what's the narrowest doorway you need to get to the main conference area?

*   Are there wheelchair spaces inside the auditorium?
    How wide are the aisles between the seats?

    Something I liked at AlterConf London was that there were dedicated wheelchair spaces embedded within the main seating.
    Often those spaces are near the back, away from the main audience, so you can't sit with your friends.
    Not here!
    Several aisle chairs had been replaced with gaps, cordoned off with blue tape, so wheelchair users could sit in the main audience with their friends.

### Encourage speakers to think about accessibility in their slides

Some simple rules can make slides much easier for everyone to read:

*   Large text
*   High-contrast colours
*   Preferably no animated GIFs on an infinite loop (as a distraction), definitely nothing bright and flashing (as an epilepsy risk)

### Remind able-bodied attendees not to interfere

If you have a code of conduct or house rules, it can be useful to remind people of basic etiquette such as:

*   Don't touch somebody's mobility or assistive devices
*   Don't pet service animals
*   If somebody is using an interpreter, talk to the person, not their interpreter


## Venue information

### Travel instructions

For anything but the smallest events, you'll have attendees who aren't local.

Provide instructions about how to get to the venue, especially if it's non-obvious (for example, does Google Maps take you to the wrong street?).

Bonus points if you provide information about wheelchair friendly routes to the venue -- your attendees don't magically appear at your front door.

### Advice on good accommodation

If you run a conference in the same place for several years, you'll get an idea of where the good accommodation is -- which hostels are friendly, which hotel is above a noisy bar, and so on.
Tell people in advance -- they'll have a better night's sleep, and enjoy your conference more!

Last year at PyCon UK, we had a block booking at a local hostel (Mrs. Potts).
Lots of people had a good stay there, we were able to solve several sudden accommodation snafus with minimal stress, and we're recommending it to our attendees again this year.

### Local information: shops, restaurants, pharmacies

There's a good chance at least one of your organisers knows the local area, and your attendees don't.
So tell them what's available -- what's good near the venue?

This could be shops, places to eat, where to get emergency medication, that sort of thing.
Help them not be stranded in a strange city when the conference is finished for the day.


## Badges, lanyards and privacy

### Be clear about how names are used

At one of the AlterConfs (I think Berlin?), you needed legal ID to get past security at the venue, so they had to know your wallet name in advance -- but that might not be what you want on your conference badge.

If you need to ask somebody's name, be clear where it will be used.
For example: *"This is needed for security on the door"* or *"This will appear on your conference badge"*.

### Use coloured lanyards to let people opt-out of photographs

Not everybody likes having their photograph taken, and you should make it easy for people to opt-out.

Approaches like "talk to an organiser" or "put a sticker for your badge" don't really work -- they scale badly, and if you take a picture of a crowd, it's hard to see if anybody has a badge sticker.

At last year's PyCon UK, we had coloured lanyards based on whether you wanted to appear in photographs -- blue if you were okay with it, bright yellow if you didn't want to.
(I think we got the idea from a DjangoCon, but I'm not sure.)
This is much easier to pick out in a crowd, and makes it clear if you've accidentally snapped somebody who ddin't want their picture taken.
