I recently wrote a small bookmarklet that gives me an editing toolbar for this site:

<img src="/images/2021/editing_toolbar.png" style="width: 706px;" alt="Screenshot of my website. I have a bookmarks sidebar open in my browser, with an item 'alexwlchan.net toolbar' highlighted in green. There's an arrow from the bookmark pointing to a bar across the top of the site, which says 'Edit this page: on GitHub / in TextMate / See the local dev preview of this page.'">

When I <a href="javascript:(function()%7Bvar%20sourcePath%20%3D%20document.querySelector(%22meta%5Bname%3Dpage-source-path%5D%22).attributes%5B%22content%22%5D.value%3Bif%20(document.location.href.startsWith(%22https%3A%2F%2Falexwlchan.net%2F%22))%20%7Bvar%20altEnvironment%20%3D%20%22local%20dev%20preview%22%3Bvar%20altUrl%20%3D%20document.location.href.replace(%22https%3A%2F%2Falexwlchan.net%2F%22%2C%20%22http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A5757%2F%22)%3B%7D%20else%20%7Bvar%20altEnvironment%20%3D%20%22live%20version%22%3Bvar%20altUrl%20%3D%20document.location.href.replace(%22http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A5757%2F%22%2C%20%22https%3A%2F%2Falexwlchan.net%2F%22)%3B%7D%2F*%20See%20https%3A%2F%2Fstackoverflow.com%2Fq%2F9038625%2F1558022%20*%2Fvar%20iOS%20%3D%20%5B'iPad%20Simulator'%2C'iPhone%20Simulator'%2C'iPod%20Simulator'%2C'iPad'%2C'iPhone'%2C'iPod'%5D.includes(navigator.platform)%20%7C%7C%20(navigator.userAgent.includes(%22Mac%22)%20%26%26%20%22ontouchend%22%20in%20document)%3Bif%20(iOS)%20%7Bdocument.querySelector(%22body%22).innerHTML%20%3D%20%60%3Carticle%20style%3D%22padding-bottom%3A%208px%3B%20padding-top%3A%208px%3B%22%3EEdit%20this%20page%3A%26nbsp%3B%3Cul%20class%3D%22dot_list%22%20style%3D%22display%3A%20inline-block%3B%20margin%3A%200%3B%22%3E%3Cli%3E%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Falexwlchan%2Falexwlchan.net%2Fblob%2Flive%2Fsrc%2F%24%7BsourcePath%7D%22%3Eon%20GitHub%3C%2Fa%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3C%2Ful%3E%3C%2Farticle%3E%60%20%2B%20document.querySelector(%22body%22).innerHTML%3B%7D%20else%20%7Bdocument.querySelector(%22body%22).innerHTML%20%3D%20%60%3Carticle%20style%3D%22padding-bottom%3A%208px%3B%20padding-top%3A%208px%3B%22%3EEdit%20this%20page%3A%26nbsp%3B%3Cul%20class%3D%22dot_list%22%20style%3D%22display%3A%20inline-block%3B%20margin%3A%200%3B%22%3E%3Cli%3E%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Falexwlchan%2Falexwlchan.net%2Fblob%2Flive%2Fsrc%2F%24%7BsourcePath%7D%22%3Eon%20GitHub%3C%2Fa%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Ca%20href%3D%22txmt%3A%2F%2Fopen%3Furl%3Dfile%3A%2F%2F~%2Frepos%2Falexwlchan.net%2Fsrc%2F%24%7BsourcePath%7D%22%3Ein%20TextMate%3C%2Fa%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3C%2Ful%3E%26nbsp%3B%2F%26nbsp%3BSee%20the%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22%24%7BaltUrl%7D%22%3E%24%7BaltEnvironment%7D%3C%2Fa%3E%20of%20this%20page%3C%2Farticle%3E%60%20%2B%20document.querySelector(%22body%22).innerHTML%3B%7D%7D)()">run the bookmarklet</a>, it adds a toolbar to the top of the page I'm looking at, which lets me do various useful things:

*   Open the page for editing on GitHub
*   Open the page for editing in my text editor in a local checkout
*   Toggle between the local preview and live versions of the site

I can't imagine anybody else wants this particular bookmarklet, but I'll explain how it works in case anybody else wants to build something similar.

First, I added the following HTML to one of my templates:

{% comment %}
The raw blocks are to stop Jekyll expanding the {{ page.path }} variable in this snippet.
{% endcomment %}

```html
{% raw %}<meta name="page-source-path" content="{{ page.path }}">{% endraw %}
```

This is a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/#page-variables">Jekyll page variable</a> that contains the path to the source code for a page.
For example, on this page this renders as:

```html
<meta name="page-source-path" content="{{ page.path }}">
```

Adding it to the template means it gets baked into every page, and I can read the value with JavaScript.

Then I have some JavaScript which reads the value, and uses it to insert the appropriate blob of HTML at the top of the page:

{% inline_code javascript _files/2021/bookmarklet.js %}

Fun fact: this is my first time using [JavaScript template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals), which are a super nice feature I wish I'd known about before.
I'm only about five years behind the cutting edge of web development!

I used [Peter Coles's bookmarklet creator](https://mrcoles.com/bookmarklet/) to turn this into my bookmarklet, and now I have an editing toolbar I can get whenever I need it.
It's been particularly useful when I want to make edits on my phone -- I can jump from a page to the source code in GitHub, make a tweak in GitHub's editor, and my [continuous deployment pipeline](/about-the-site/) will publish the updated version shortly afterwards.

I can't imagine anyone else wants this exact bookmarklet, but if you have your own static site then something like this might be useful.
