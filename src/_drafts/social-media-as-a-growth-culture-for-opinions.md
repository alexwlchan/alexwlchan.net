title: Social media as a growth culture for opinions
summary: Using social media can lead us to have more opinions than we really need. Can we fix that?
---

Back in March, David wrote about [the art of not having opinions](https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-09-11:13.html).
He argues that we probably have plenty of opinions that we don't need.
If there's a topic we don't need to hold an opinion on, and we wouldn't even know if it was wrong, do we need to hold it?

This broadly tracks with my experience.
Over the last few years, I've noticed that having less opinions makes me happier, especially if I drop opinions about topics I don't really care about.

In his post, David talks about how we're socially compelled to have opinions.
We use opinions as a bonding activity, as a way to sort people into different groups.
We ask people their opinion about topics we care about, and use that to sort friend from foe.

When he [tweeted a link to the article](https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1237000767917211650), David said, *"You probably have all sorts of opinions you don't need to (after all, you're on Twitter)"*.
Since then, I've been thinking about how social media compels us to have more opinions.

Scrolling through Twitter is to be bombarded with opinions, and as humans we're prone to copy the people we see around us.
For any topic, there are people who have strong opinions, and at some point you'll see their tweets.
The people who don't have an opinion tend not to talk about it (what would they have to say?), so we don't see them.
Even if the people with opinions are a tiny minority, that's what we see most of, and that's the behaviour we emulate.

If you use social media, you might have noticed this as a nagging sensation to talk about the topic de jour.
Everyone you follow is sharing their opinion about something, and you feel compelled to add your thoughts.
How would your followers feel if you didn't express your outrage/enthusiasm/anger about a particular event?
What would they think if you had the *wrong* opinion.

(The reality is, unless you're fairly prominent, nobody is going to notice.)

I noticed this sensation a couple of years back, which is what led to me consciously dialling back my opinions.
I still tweet plenty, but I try not to say something just to have an opinion.

This isn't a new problem, but social media makes it worse.
The people who have an opinion have always been more prominent than those without, but social media massively expands the number of people whose opinions we can read and hear.
I can read dozens of new opinions before I've had breakfast, and it amplifies the urge to have my own.

This scale isn't exclusively a bad thing -- by listening to people with a variety of interests, my life is full of novelty and information I'd otherwise have missed.
I enjoy hearing people talk excitedly about a topic that I know nothing about!
Enthusiasm is infectious, and seeing them be excited about their interests gives me permission to be excited about my own.
But you can have too much of a bad thing.

I've tried to fight this by being more selective about who I follow, and aiming for a balance of whimsy and opinions.
If you mostly post low-stakes opinions and photos of your pet?
That's worth a follow.
If it's wall-to-wall discourse and anger?
I'll close the tab.

There's a tendency to characterise social media as absolute evil ("it rots children's brains!") or a paragon of goodness.
As with most things, it's more complicated than that, and if you take it at face value things won't change.
Making more conscious and careful choices about social media consumption has made me happier using it.
