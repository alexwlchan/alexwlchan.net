title: Social media as a growth culture for opinions
summary: Using social media can lead us to have more opinions than we really need. Can we fix that?

Back in March, David wrote about [the art of not having opinions](https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-09-11:13.html).
He talks about how we're socially compelled to have lots of opinions.
We use opinions as a bonding activity, as a way to sort people into different groups.
We ask people their opinion about topics we care about, and use that to sort friend from foe.

When he [tweeted a link to the article](https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1237000767917211650), he said, *"You probably have all sorts of opinions you don't need to (after all, you're on Twitter)"*.
Since then, I've been thinking about how social media compels us to have more opinions.

If you scroll through Twitter, you're bombarded with opinions, and as humans we're prone to copy the behaviour of people we see around us.
The people with opinions are the ones who tweet; people without opinions are much quieter.
Even if the chatty ones are a tiny minority of Twitter users as a whole, that's what we see most of, and that's the behaviour we emulate.

Compared to pre-internet life, social media massively increases the number of people we can hear from.
I can read dozens of new opinions before I've had breakfast, and it amplifies the urge to have my own.

A few years back, I started to notice a nagging sensation to tweet about the topic de jour.
Everyone I followed was sharing their opinion about something, and I felt compelled to add my own thoughts to the mix.
What would my followers think if I didn't express your outrage/enthusiasm/anger about the latest event.
The reality is that nobody would notice, but that didn't make the nagging feeling go away.

Noticing this sensation is what led to me trying to dial back my opinions.
I still tweet plenty, but I try not to say something just so I've had an opinion.

I've tried to fight this by being more selective about who I follow, and aiming for a balance of whimsy and opinions.
If you mostly post low-stakes opinions and photos of your pet?
Worth a follow.
If it's wall-to-wall discourse and anger?
Close the tab.

I mostly use social media as a leisure activity, and a way to chat to my friends, but that doesn't mean I should use it mindlessly.
Being more careful and conscious about my social media consumption has made me happier using it.
