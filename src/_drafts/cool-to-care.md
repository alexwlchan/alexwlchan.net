title: It’s cool to care

I’m in a small coffee shop in New York. It’s warm and cosy inside, and it’s just started to snow outside.
I’m here for the opening of *Operation Mincemeat* on Broadway. Last night was the dress rehearsal, and tonight is the opening preview.
I’ve seen this show more times than I can count, and I hope American audiences love it as much British ones do.

The people who make the show will tell you that it's a show about a ragtag bunch of misfits who thought they could do something ridiculous, who had the audacity to believe in something unlikely.

That’s one way to see the show. The musical is based on the true story of a group of British spies who stole a corpse, dressed it as a British officer, and dumped it in the sea with forged documents, all in an attempt to fool Hitler. And the show was created in a similar way: it was written by a group of four friends who started in a tiny theatre in London, went through a series of transfers, and now find themselves about to open on Broadway.

But I think it’s more than that: it’s a story about friendship.
How we need our friends to help us, to inspire us, to push us to be the best versions of ourselves.

The arrogant leader who needs a team to help him truly achieve.
The nervous scientist who learns to stand up for himself from his friends.
The excitable secretary who learns wisdom and resilience from her elder.

And so it feels fitting that I’m not in New York on my own.
I’m here with friends – dozens of friends who I met through the show.

At first, I was just an audience member.
Over time, that changed.
Going to *Operation Mincemeat* in London was my first experience of a theatre stage door.
I had so much fun at the show, I wanted to stay longer and thank the cast.
And while I was waiting for them to come out, I got chatting with the other people who were waiting with me.
Those conversations turned into a Discord, then a WhatsApp, then trips to the theatre together (for many shows besides *Mincemeat*).
I spent NYE with these friends, sitting on somebody’s floor and laughing about a bowl of limes like it was the funniest thing in the world.

And now we’re here in New York together.

Believing that I could meet such a large, creative, kind group of people might seem as unlikely as the premise of *Mincemeat* itself.
But we believed it in anyway, and here we are.

I feel so lucky to have met these people, to take this ridiculous trip, to share these precious days with them. I know what a privilege that is – the time, the money, the ability to say *let’s do this* and make it happen. And I hope that long after this trip, we’ll still be a part of each other’s lives.

You might think it’s silly to see a show this many times.
Some people would never see the same show twice, and most of us are comfortably into double or triple-figures.

Whenever somebody asks *why*, I don’t have a good answer. Because it’s fun? Because it’s touching? Because I enjoy it? I feel the need to justify it, as if there’s some logical reason that will make all of this okay. But maybe I don’t have to. Maybe joy doesn’t need justification.

A theatre show doesn’t happen without people who care.
Neither does a friendship.

So much of our culture tells us that it’s not cool to care. It’s better to be detached, dismissive, disinterested. Enthusiasm is cringe. Sincerity is weakness.

Fuck that.

I’m a big fan of being a big fan of things.
So many of the best things in my life have come from caring deeply, from letting myself be involved, from finding people who are a big fan of the same things as me.

I don’t know where the drive to be detached comes from.
Maybe it’s to protect ourselves, a way to guard against disappointment.
If you don’t care, you can’t be hurt.
I disagree.

Caring – deeply, foolishly, vulnerably – is how I connect with people.
My friends and I care about this show, and we care about each other, and we care about our joy.

That care and love for each other is what brought us together, and without it we wouldn’t be here in this city.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime trip.
So many stars had to align  – for us to meet, for the show to be successful, for us to be able to travel together.
And those stars only aligned because we cared.

I know so many other friends who would have loved to be here but can’t be, for all kinds of reasons.
I also know their absence isn’t for lack of caring, and they want the show to do well whether or not they’re here.
I’m reminded of a quote by Tennyson: it’s better to care about something you cannot affect, than to care about nothing at all.
In a world that’s full of cynicism and spite and hatred, I feel that now more than ever.

Maybe you saw *Operation Mincemeat* and it wasn’t for you. Maybe you’re not a theatre kid. Maybe you aren’t into musicals, or history, or war stories.

That’s okay.
I don’t mind if you care about different things to me.
(Imagine how boring that would be!)

But I want you to care about *something*.

My drink is getting cold, so it’s time to finish it, head out, and meet my friends.
Because in this city, in this moment, with these people?
I’m so glad that I cared.
