Go is a programming language designed at Google with a particular focus on concurrency.
Apps written in Go include [Docker][wiki-docker], [Kubernetes][wiki-kubernetes], and [Caddy][wiki-caddy] (the web server that runs this blog).

I started learning Go in summer 2025, when I started working at Tailscale (which uses Go for both the end-user client and back-end coordination server).
