I love it when people tell me they enjoyed something I made!
A nice message can make my day.

The best way to get in touch with me is by email: **<alex@alexwlchan.net>**.
(I'm bad at replying to emails in a timely manner, but I'm trying to get better!)

I use the handle **alexwlchan** fairly consistently on the rest of the web.
I'm pretty quiet on social media right now, but if you really want you can follow me there:

*   GitHub: <https://github.com/alexwlchan/>
*   Instagram: <https://www.instagram.com/alexwlchan/>
*   LinkedIn: <https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexwlchan/>
*   Mastodon: <https://social.alexwlchan.net/@alex>
*   Twitter: <https://twitter.com/alexwlchan>

I read my notifications and private messages, but less often than emails.
