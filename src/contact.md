The best way to get in touch with me is by email:

{% include contact/emails.html %}

I love it when people tell me they enjoyed something I made!
A nice email can make my day.

I also use the handle **alexwlchan** pretty consistently on the rest of web.
I'm not especially active on social media right now, but you can follow me on the following sites.
I don't post frequently.

I read my notifications and private messages, but at a slower cadence than emails.

{% include contact/socials.html %}

If you're old school, you can also subscribe to [my RSS feed](/atom.xml) and get new articles in your feed reader.
