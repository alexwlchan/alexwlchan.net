I love it when people tell me they enjoyed something I made!
A nice message can make my day!

The best way to get in touch with me is by email: **<alex@alexwlchan.net>**.
(I'm bad at replying to emails in a timely manner, but I'm trying to get better!)

I use the handle **alexwlchan** fairly consistently on the rest of the web.
(This is a username my aunt suggested for my first Hotmail address in 2004, and I've stuck with it ever since.
The "w" and "l" are my middle initials, but I'm not going to tell you what they stand for.)

I'm pretty quiet on social media right now, but you can follow me there:

*   GitHub: <https://github.com/alexwlchan/>
*   Instagram: <https://www.instagram.com/alexwlchan/>
*   LinkedIn: <https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexwlchan/>
*   Mastodon: <https://social.alexwlchan.net/@alex>
*   Twitter: <https://twitter.com/alexwlchan>

I read my notifications and private messages, but less often than emails.
