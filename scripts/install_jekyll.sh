# See https://alexwlchan.net/2023/check-for-transparency/
apt-get install --yes imagemagick

# Required by the http-proofer gem, which is used by the linter plugin.
# Without it, I get an error:
#
#     Could not open library 'libcurl.so.4': libcurl.so.4
#
# I tried `apt-get install libcurl-dev` and was offered three options:
#
#     Package libcurl-dev is a virtual package provided by:
#       libcurl4-openssl-dev 7.74.0-1.3+deb11u3
#       libcurl4-nss-dev 7.74.0-1.3+deb11u3
#       libcurl4-gnutls-dev 7.74.0-1.3+deb11u3
#     You should explicitly select one to install.
#
# I don't know what the different between them is, so I picked arbitrarily.
apt-get install --yes libcurl4-gnutls-dev

# Actually install the Ruby gems!
bundle install

# These packages are only required for installation, and I can remove them
# from the final image.
apt-get remove --yes build-essential zlib1g-dev
apt autoremove --yes
